b'MR JUSTICE CHRISTOPHER CLARKE:   \tOn 14\xc2\xa0December\xc2\xa02012 I\xc2\xa0ordered that there should be judgment against Mr\xc2\xa0Mikhaylyuk, the Ruperti defendants, and the Nikitin defendants in respect of the principal due in the light of the judgment that I\xc2\xa0had handed down shortly before.\r\n   \tI\xc2\xa0ordered that a\xc2\xa0hearing should take place today in order to assess pre-judgment interest.\r\n   The dispute \tThere is a\xc2\xa0dispute on which a\xc2\xa0large sum of money potentially turns as to the date from which interest should be calculated under the  Judgments Act 1838 .  The claimants contend that pre-judgment interest on the principal should be calculated up to 14\xc2\xa0December\xc2\xa02012, and that interest at the Judgments Act rate of 8\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent should run on the sum of the principal and the interest thereafter, that is to say from and including the day after 14\xc2\xa0December.\r\n   \tIn this ruling I\xc2\xa0deal with the issue as between the claimants and the Nikitin defendants who, through Mr\xc2\xa0Steven Berry QC, have made submissions that I\xc2\xa0should adopt a\xc2\xa0different course. I\xc2\xa0shall consider the impact of this ruling on the defendants other than the Nikitin defendants hereafter.\r\n   \tThe Nikitin defendants contend that the interest calculations which have been prepared down to 14\xc2\xa0December should be continued down to today, and that Judgments Act interest on the principal and on the interest thus calculated should begin tomorrow.\r\n   \tThere is also a\xc2\xa0dispute as to the rate at which Judgments Act interest should be paid. Section\xc2\xa017 of the  Judgments Act 1838  provides as follows:\r\n   "1\tEvery judgment debt shall carry interest at the rate of 8\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent per annum from such time as shall be prescribed by rules of court until the same shall be satisfied and such interest may be levied under a\xc2\xa0writ of execution on such judgment.   2.\t Rules of court may provide for the court to disallow all or part of any interest otherwise payable under subsection\xc2\xa01." \tThere is a\xc2\xa0minor issue as to how the Act should now be read.  That which I\xc2\xa0have set out comes from  Lexis . As originally enacted the Act read as follows:\r\n   "Every judgment debt shall carry interest at the rate of \xc2\xa3 4 per centum per annum from the time of entering up the judgment\xc2\xa0... until the same shall be satisfied and such interest may be levied under a\xc2\xa0writ of execution on such judgment ." \tIn the current edition of  Halsbury\'s Statutes  the first subsection is set out as follows:\r\n   "Every judgment debt shall carry interest at the rate of [8 pounds per centum per annum] from such time as shall be prescribed by rules of court\xc2\xa0... until the same shall be satisfied and such interest may be levied under a\xc2\xa0writ of execution on such judgment ." \tThe difference arises because the relevant order which produced the latest change in subsection\xc2\xa01 of section\xc2\xa017\xc2\xa0-- that is to say the  Judgment Debts (Rate of Interest) Order 1993 \xc2\xa0-- provided as follows:\r\n   "( 2)  In relation to any judgment entered up after the coming into force of this order, section\xc2\xa017 of the Judgments Act 1838 shall be amended so as to substitute for the rate specified in that section as the rate at which judgment shall carry interest the rate of 8\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent per annum." \tIt appears, therefore, that the inclusion in Halsbury of the words "8  pounds per centum per annum " does not represent the Act in the form amended by the 1993 order.\r\n   \tLittle turns upon this, save that Mr\xc2\xa0Berry submitted that the way in which the Act is expressed in  Halsbury \xc2\xa0-- that is to say with the reference to " 8 pounds per centum per annum" \xc2\xa0-- served to make it plain beyond argument that the rate could not be treated as constituting any form of default rate in relation to a\xc2\xa0currency other than pounds.\r\n   \tCPR 40.8 provides as follows:\r\n   "(1) Where interest is payable on a\xc2\xa0judgment pursuant to section\xc2\xa017 of the Judgments Act 1838\xc2\xa0... the interest shall begin to run from the date that judgment is given unless\xc2\xa0\xc2\x96 . ..  (b) the court orders otherwise.  (2) The court may order that interest shall begin to run from a\xc2\xa0date before the date that judgment is given." \tSection\xc2\xa044(a) of the  Administration of Justice Act 1970  which was inserted by section\xc2\xa01.1 of the  Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995  provides:\r\n   "(1) Where a\xc2\xa0judgment is given for a\xc2\xa0sum expressed in a\xc2\xa0currency other than sterling, and the judgment debt is one to which section\xc2\xa017 of the Judgments Act 1838 applies, the court may order that the interest rate applicable to the debt shall be such sum as the court thinks fit.   (2) Where the court makes such an\xc2\xa0order, section 17 of the Judgments Act 1838 shall have effect in relation to the judgment debt as if the rate specified in the order were substituted for the rate specified in that section."   When does the judgment debt arise? \tThe first question, therefore, is when is the date on which judgment was, or will have been, given such that a\xc2\xa0judgment debt arose or will arise?  It is clear from  Thomas v\xc2\xa0Bunn  [1991] 1 AC 362 that it is not the date of any judgment for damages to be assessed. In that case the court had to consider section\xc2\xa017 in its then form (see para 7 above).\r\n   \tLord Ackner, with whom the other members of the House agreed, said this:\r\n   " If the words used in this section are considered in isolation, the problem would not appear to be a\xc2\xa0difficult one.  It is accepted there cannot be a\xc2\xa0judgment debt until there is a\xc2\xa0judgment for a\xc2\xa0quantified sum, i.e. a\xc2\xa0final as contrasted with an interlocutory judgment.  Such a\xc2\xa0final judgment is to carry interest from the time of entering up \'the judgment\', i.e. the judgment which creates the judgment debt, i.e. the final judgment.  This is made doubly clear by the provision that the interest shall run \'until the same shall be satisfied\'.  Until there is a\xc2\xa0quantified sum which the judgment debtor is obliged by the terms of the judgment to pay, there is no judgment which he is able to satisfy.  The final provision in the section that \'such interest may be levied under a\xc2\xa0writ of execution on such judgment\' must refer to the judgment which has created the judgment debt.  That is the final judgment." \tMuch of the case was concerned with the anomaly that an\xc2\xa0order for the payment of costs to be taxed has been held to have to be construed for the purposes of section\xc2\xa017 as a\xc2\xa0judgment debt, and as to the significance, if any, of that fact, to the matters under consideration by the House.\r\n   \tAt page 380G Lord Ackner said as follows:\r\n   " The wording of section\xc2\xa017 clearly envisages a\xc2\xa0single judgment which constitutes the \'judgment debt\'.  This \'judgment debt\' can only arise where the judgment itself quantifies the sum which the judgment debtor owes to his judgment creditor.  The language of the section does not envisage an interlocutory judgment, but only a\xc2\xa0final judgment.  This was clearly the view of Kindersley VC in Garner\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Griggs [1858] 27 LJ Ch 483. \tHaving cited from that case, he said:\r\n   " I\xc2\xa0accordingly take the view the judgment referred to in section\xc2\xa017 of the Judgments Act 1838 does not relate to an interlocutory or interim order or judgment establishing only the defendant\'s liability.  The judgment contemplated by that section is the judgment which quantifies the defendant\'s liability, the judgment which has been referred to in the course of these appeals as \'the damages judgment\'.  The artificial distinction drawn in the Borthwick case, based on the precise terms on which damages are ordered to be assessed, can no longer stand." \tThe Nikitin defendants contend that interest under the  Judgments Act  begins to accrue when the court makes a\xc2\xa0final order identifying their total liability, and that that cannot be before today.\r\n   \tThe judgment debt which carries interest under the  Judgments Act  will in this case, they say, be the aggregate of the amounts set out in the judgment of 14\xc2\xa0December, and the amounts to be set out in today\'s judgment. It is, as the House noted in  Thomas\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Bunn , necessary to look at the substance and not the form.  This, they submit, is particularly so in case such as this, where the pre-judgment interest compounded at quarterly rests is part of the calculation of the profits which the court has ordered the Nikitin defendants to disgorge in respect of the Henriot Finance charters.\r\n   \tIn that respect my attention has been drawn to a\xc2\xa0note in the White Book at 40.8.9, which reads as follows:\r\n   "Where there is a\xc2\xa0judgment for debt or damages, normally it will include the principal sum (say \xc2\xa3 50,000) plus any interest awarded by the court (say \xc2\xa3 5,000) and the total sum (\xc2\xa3 55,000) will constitute the judgment debt.  Such a\xc2\xa0judgment may be not only a\xc2\xa0judgment given at the end of a\xc2\xa0contested trial, but a\xc2\xa0consent order or a\xc2\xa0judgment on admissions." \tThen a\xc2\xa0little later:\r\n   "\xc2\x85in accordance with rule 40.8, the resulting judgment debt (i.e. the \xc2\xa355,000) may carry interest until it is satisfied." \tThat illustrates, Mr\xc2\xa0Berry submits, that it is a\xc2\xa0judgment which quantifies the entirety of the sum of principal and interest which is the only judgment in relation to which  Judgments Act  interest is to be paid.\r\n   \tIt is material to note that in  Thomas\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Bunn  the choice which the court had to make was between holding that interest under the Act should run (i) from the date of the judgment for damages to be assessed; or (ii) from the date when the damages were determined.  It was not concerned with a\xc2\xa0situation, such as arises in this case, where judgment for the principal is given on one day and interest is determined and judgment given in respect of it on a\xc2\xa0later day.\r\n   \tThere was in  Thomas v Bunn  only one judgment which ordered the defendants to make an identified payment.  It was in that context that Lord\xc2\xa0Ackner said that the wording of section\xc2\xa017 envisaged " a\xc2\xa0single judgment " which constitutes the judgment debt.\r\n   \tThat does not in my view mean that when there are two judgments, one for principal and a\xc2\xa0later one for interest, each of which contains quantified sums, the  Judgments Act  interest cannot run under the former until the giving of the latter.\r\n   \tIn such a\xc2\xa0case there will not be a\xc2\xa0single judgment for the whole amount due.  Nor does it seem to me that the passage in the White Book was directed to a\xc2\xa0set of circumstances such as the present.\r\n   \tI\xc2\xa0do not therefore regard  Thomas\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Bunn  as compelling the conclusion that interest can only run from the date upon which the court makes a\xc2\xa0final order which, when taken with its earlier order, identifies the Nikitin defendants\' total liability for principal and interest.\r\n   \tSection\xc2\xa017 refers to a\xc2\xa0judgment debt carrying interest.  CPR 40.8 provides that interest shall run from the date that judgment is given.  Of necessity these provisions require that judgment be given for an identifiable sum on which interest can be calculated.  But where judgment is given for the principal sum first, that judgment constitutes a\xc2\xa0final judgment for a\xc2\xa0quantified sum, such as  Thomas\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Bunn  holds to be necessary.\r\n   \tIndeed, it is the only judgment which will ever be given for that sum.  Any judgment that I\xc2\xa0give now will be in respect of interest only.  But for the stay the defendants would have been obliged to make payment in respect of that judgment, and execution could be levied in respect of it.  I\xc2\xa0see no good reason why the judgment of 14\xc2\xa0December should be held not by itself to fall within section\xc2\xa017, particularly when the section speaks of " Every judgment " as carrying a\xc2\xa0right to interest.\r\n   Interest on the principal \tI\xc2\xa0propose therefore to order that interest under the  Judgments Act  on the principal sums for which I\xc2\xa0gave judgment on 14\xc2\xa0December shall run from that date.\r\n   Interest on the pre-judgment interest \tIn respect of pre-judgment interest\xc2\xa0-- that is to say interest on the principal sums down to 14\xc2\xa0December\xc2\xa02012\xc2\xa0-- the position is that there has been no judgment which determines what is the amount due.  At the hearing on 14\xc2\xa0December, the questions of rate and compounding were determined, and an\xc2\xa0estimate of some US$ 48\xc2\xa0million was given in respect of the relevant interest.\r\n   \tI\xc2\xa0ordered the making of an interim payment of US$ 30\xc2\xa0million, although that is subject to a\xc2\xa0stay. But no sum in respect of the totality of the interest has yet been fixed, or, save as to the US$ 30\xc2\xa0million, ordered to be paid.\r\n   \tThe claimants say that in those circumstances I\xc2\xa0should order that interest on interest should run from 14\xc2\xa0December, pursuant to the power given to the court under CPR 40.8(2) to order that interest run from a\xc2\xa0date before the date, i.e. today, when judgment is given in respect of the interest down to 14\xc2\xa0December.\r\n   \tThey submit that it was obvious from 14\xc2\xa0December that a\xc2\xa0large sum of interest was going to be due.  If matters had been dealt with on 14\xc2\xa0December, there would have been a\xc2\xa0judgment for the sum of the principal and interest, and interest would accrue on that sum. There is, they say, no good reason why they should be denied the interest on interest which they would have recovered if the matter had been dealt with on 14\xc2\xa0December.\r\n   \tWere it otherwise, claimants would be unjustifiably disadvantaged if the calculation of interest had to take place after the principal was ascertained, either because the court ran out of time or because there was some delay for which the claimant was not to blame, or for other reasons.\r\n   \tThe Nikitin defendants say that if the claimants are to get  Judgments Act  interest on the principal from 14\xc2\xa0December, they should only get Judgments Act interest on the interest on and from tomorrow.  The claimants will already be getting interest on the principal from 14\xc2\xa0December. They should not get interest on the interest down to 14\xc2\xa0December from 14\xc2\xa0December as well.  The fact that they might have got such interest if all the calculations had been in place, and there was time to argue the interest issue, on 14\xc2\xa0December, cannot justify them getting interest on interest when those conditions did not exist.\r\n   \tI\xc2\xa0have come to the conclusion that the interest calculation should be carried down to 14\xc2\xa0December, and that there should be  Judgments Act  interest on the interest thus calculated thereafter.\r\n   \tIn ordinary course a\xc2\xa0successful claimant gets his judgment for principal and interest at the same time, at any rate in a\xc2\xa0case which is not as sizeable as this one. \r\n   \tDepending on the facts of the case, that interest may have been compounded, as it is in the present case at quarterly rests.  He is then entitled from the date of judgment to interest on the sum of the principal and the interest. But any compounding ceases. Simple interest on the interest down to the date of judgment is some recompense for the absence of further compounding after the date of the judgment.\r\n   \tThe following circumstances seem to me of relevance in the present case.  Firstly, there has been a\xc2\xa0short interval of time between the determination of the principal and the determination of the interest.\r\n   \tSecondly, most of the interest is being compounded with quarterly rests, as agreed by the parties in the light of a\xc2\xa0similar course taken by Mr Justice Andrew Smith in  Fiona\xc2\xa0Trust .\r\n   \tThirdly, there has been no culpable delay.\r\n   \tFourthly, it would not, I\xc2\xa0think, have been practical for the court to have dealt with interest on 14\xc2\xa0December, having regard to the size of the issues then to be dealt with and the complications in relation to interest.\r\n   \tFifthly, I\xc2\xa0have decided to award  Judgments Act  interest from 14\xc2\xa0December, thus bringing any compounding to an end.\r\n   \tIn those circumstances, it seems to me that the right order is that interest shall run from 14\xc2\xa0December.  If I\xc2\xa0were to order  Judgments Act  interest to run on the principal from 14\xc2\xa0December, but for there to be no interest on interest running until tomorrow, the claimants would in my judgment be unacceptably prejudiced.  Compounding would have ceased on 14\xc2\xa0December, without the benefit of interest on interest thereafter.\r\n   The rate \tI\xc2\xa0turn then to the rate of interest.  The judgment rate on sterling sums is 8\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent per annum.  The court does not have power to alter that rate, as Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Hamblen observed in  Standard Chartered Bank v Ceylon Petroleum Corporation   [2011] EWHC 2094 (Comm)  citing  Schlumberger Holdings Limited v Electromagnetic Geoservices  [2009] EWHC 773 per Mann J.\r\n   \tThe court does, however, have a\xc2\xa0discretion as to the date from which interest shall begin, which may be before judgment.\r\n   \tFurther, in the case of the Nikitin defendants, the judgment is in dollars, and section\xc2\xa044(a) of the 1970 Act gives the court a discretion as to the rate in the terms which I\xc2\xa0have set out.\r\n   \tThe claimants contend that there is no good reason to depart from the 8\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent figure for sterling because the judgment is in dollars.  Whatever might have been the original basis for the specified interest figure for sterling, it has stood at 8\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent since 1993, i.e. nearly 20\xc2\xa0years ago, and should no longer be regarded as tracking actual interest rates over any given period.\r\n   \tInstead, it is to be regarded as: \r\n   "... providing a\xc2\xa0consistent, readily ascertainable, easily applied interest rate for judgment debts.  In deciding whether to adjust the rate it cannot therefore simply be relevant to note that there is a\xc2\xa0discrepancy between the judgment rate and the applicable rate of the currency (at least unless this discrepancy is significantly larger than that between base plus 1\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent and the judgment rate)."                                         [Claimants\' skeleton para 21.4]   Discussion \tThe primary purpose of an award for interest is to compensate the creditor for having been kept out of his money, not to penalise the paying party, as I\xc2\xa0decided in relation to interest on costs: see  Fattal\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0Fattal v Walbrook Trustees (Jersey) Limited and Another   [2009] 4 Costs LR 591 .\r\n   \tInterest should restore a\xc2\xa0claimant to the position in which it would have been if it had received the money.  Since the claimant may be kept out of his money, the award of interest should cover the cost of borrowing such money. This is the essential basis for pre-judgment interest, and there seems to me no sufficient reason for a\xc2\xa0different approach in relation to interest post judgment.\r\n   \tThe rate fixed by the Lord Chancellor for sterling debts was intended to reflect sterling interest rates prevailing in the United\xc2\xa0Kingdom, as appears from the  Report on International Law\xc2\xa0-- Foreign Money Liabilities  of the Law Commission (No 124 (1983), Cmnd 9064) referred to by Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Hamblen in  SCB v Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.   \tThe fact that the Lord Chancellor has failed to amend the rate in recent years, so that the current rate is 16 times the current base rate, does not seem to me to mandate a\xc2\xa0departure from this principle on the basis that it must now be regarded as a\xc2\xa0rate fixed to encourage the payment of debts, or simply as a\xc2\xa0figure to take which may protect a\xc2\xa0claimant whose judgment debtor is a\xc2\xa0long time in paying against the vicissitudes of the money markets, so that, in consequence, the court must, or should, in respect of  post judgment interest now take a different approach to that adopted in  Fattal  and  SCB v Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.   \tThe 8\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent figure certainly cannot be regarded as some sort of default rate for non-sterling debts, save in the sense that if no one suggests otherwise, it will be applicable. Nor can it be taken to represent the current rate for borrowing in dollars, or indeed in sterling.  The purpose of section\xc2\xa044(a) was, as Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Hamblen said in  SCB v Ceylon Petroleum :\r\n   "... to enable the court to award interest at a\xc2\xa0rate appropriate to the currency in question." Such a\xc2\xa0rate would reflect the cost of borrowing in that currency. \tMr\xc2\xa0Dominic Dowley QC, on behalf of the claimants, accepted that if the currency in which judgment was given was a\xc2\xa0currency where there was very high inflation, it might be appropriate to vary the 8\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent rate upwards.  Otherwise the value of the claimants\' judgment might be unacceptably diminished.  Similarly, if the rate for borrowing in respect of the relevant foreign currency was very low in comparison with the 8\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent, he accepted that it might be appropriate to adjust the rate downwards in favour of the defendant.\r\n   \tIt seems to me equally appropriate to vary the rate so as to produce what is an appropriate figure. I\xc2\xa0do not regard it as necessary, if the rate is to be varied, for the difference between 8\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent and the appropriate foreign currency rate to be characterised as very marked.  Nor does it seem to me relevant to examine the extent to which 8\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent exceeds relevant sterling rates, compared with the extent to which 8\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent exceeds relevant US\xc2\xa0dollar rates, and to apply the 8\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent to dollar debts simply because the difference is less in the latter than in the former case.\r\n   \tIn exercise of the discretion that I\xc2\xa0have under section\xc2\xa044(a)), I\xc2\xa0propose to fix the rate under the  Judgments Act  at three-monthly US LIBOR plus 2.5\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent, the rate at which I\xc2\xa0have already ordered pre-judgment interest to be calculated.  That rate was a\xc2\xa0rate agreed by the parties in relation to pre-judgment interest as the most appropriate interest rate.  It is the main commercial rate for borrowing US\xc2\xa0dollars in London, and the claimants\' business is conducted from London and is mainly in United\xc2\xa0States dollars.\r\n   \tBy that I\xc2\xa0mean that the rate at which  Judgments Act  interest is to be payable is to be three-monthly US LIBOR plus 2.5\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent, as it is from quarter to quarter.  It does not seem to me appropriate, having regard to the principles on which I\xc2\xa0am acting, to fix a\xc2\xa0rate which is unchanging since that itself may prejudice one side or the other. That may make the calculation of interest more complicated than it would otherwise be, but in a\xc2\xa0case where interest runs to tens of millions, that seems to me a\xc2\xa0fact of limited importance.\r\n   \tThe question was raised as to whether I\xc2\xa0could fix a\xc2\xa0rate that changed from time to time, having regard to the terms of section\xc2\xa044(a) and the reference to " such rate as the court thinks fit ".\r\n   \tI\xc2\xa0am satisfied that I\xc2\xa0can.  It does not seem to me that that section was intended to be confined to a\xc2\xa0rate specified by a\xc2\xa0single figure. It can be one defined in the manner which I\xc2\xa0have stated, and if it is so defined, that is the best way of giving effect to the compensatory principle. \r\n   \tIt was also submitted that if I\xc2\xa0was not going to take 8\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent, I\xc2\xa0should not take a\xc2\xa0rate as low as three-monthly US LIBOR plus 2.5\xc2\xa0per\xc2\xa0cent or US prime, which is somewhat, but not much, higher. This was said to be because such rates would produce less than what the Nikitin defendants have been due to pay up until now, because, as from the date when  Judgments Act  interest begins, compounding will cease, whereas interest has been calculated to date with compounding. I\xc2\xa0should, accordingly, select some higher figure.\r\n   \tI\xc2\xa0am not satisfied that that is a\xc2\xa0good ground for making a\xc2\xa0different order to the one which I\xc2\xa0propose.  The fact that compounding will cease is a\xc2\xa0necessary consequence of the giving of judgment, unless, perhaps, there is an agreement that compounding will apply as well after as before judgment.  It does not, in my judgment, constitute a\xc2\xa0ground, or at any rate a\xc2\xa0sufficient ground, for selecting a\xc2\xa0rate different to the one which I\xc2\xa0propose. \r\n   '
