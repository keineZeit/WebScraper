b'Mr Justice David Steel :   The dispute This  CPR Part 8  claim concerns the proper construction of a drilling rig charter.  The Claimant ("BP") seeks a declaration that it is entitled at any time so as "to suit the convenience" of BP to terminate Contract No. 104288 ("the agreement") relating to the semi-submersible drilling rig BYFORD DOLPHIN which is owned and operated by the Defendant ("Dolphin").  Dolphin contends that BP has no contractual entitlement to terminate the agreement for that reason until after the prescribed commencement date for drilling work under the terms of the agreement.\r   The issue is of some urgency as BP is contemplating exercising the contractual right of termination (if available) now against the background of a provision for delivery of the rig for service in early 2010 for a period of three years.  Dolphin contends that BP can only purport to do so by way of a repudiatory breach of the agreement. \r   The financial implications of the dispute are considerable.  It is BP\'s case that the contractual right of termination expressly holds it harmless from any liability for loss of profit incurred by Dolphin by reference to the three year term.  Indeed BP further seeks a declaration that, in the event of termination, the only payments to which Dolphin is entitled are any sums due for work performed prior to termination (including modification and upgrades under the terms of the contract).  \r   The agreement In resolving the dispute it will be necessary to refer to a large number of the provisions of the agreement.  Not surprisingly it is very long.  The major part is contained in a written form of agreement with eight sections running to 170 pages dated 23 March 2009.  It also incorporated numerous amendments and additions to the standard form of contract known as LOGIC General Conditions of Contract for Drilling Rigs (Ed 1 - December 1997).  Further amendments were made by Amendment No. 1 dated 6 May 2009.  For ease of reference a conformed version of the relevant parts of the contract is annexed to this judgment.   Broadly speaking the amendments and additions to the standard form are highlighted in italics.  The footnotes give relevant cross references to the hearing bundle. \r   The background The issue is essentially one of construction.  The relevant background circumstances can be expressed quite shortly.  The parties had earlier entered into Heads of Agreement dated 10 September 2008.  This made provision for an exclusive arrangement to negotiate a final agreement in respect of a "selected nominated rig" for a three year contract at an indicative rate of $410,000 per day, with drilling operations planned to commence in the last quarter of 2009 or the first quarter of 2010.\r   This arrangement was exclusive in the sense (as emphasised by Dolphin) it was agreed that marketing of the selected rig after 12 September 2008 could only be put into effect for "work that is not in competition" with BP\'s planned operations.  The Heads of Agreement were extended to 2 October 2008 at which stage the contract was awarded to Dolphin with a Commencement Date no earlier than 1 January 2010 or later than 31 March 2010.  It was finally signed in March 2009.\r   The broad structure of the agreement is fairly simple. (I use the word agreement because there is a dispute as to the meaning of the word "Contract" as used from time to time within the provisions of the agreement.)\r   i)\tThe Contract was between BP and Dolphin and was contained in the documents referred to above: Sec. I. 2. ii)\tCapitalised words were to have the meanings assigned to them: CONTRACT ("Contract") was said to be one and WORK ("Work") another: Sec I. 1. iii)\tThe terms of the Contract applied from 23 March 2009 being the Effective Date: Sec I. 4. iv)\tThe Commencement Date was to be no earlier than 1 January 2010 and no later than 31 March 2010 when the rig was under tow to the first drilling location following completion of all preparatory work: Sec I. 5. v)\tThe duration of the Contract was to be 3 years from the Commencement Date: Sec I. 6. vi)\tBP was entitled to terminate the Work or the Contract at any time for a number of specified reasons including its own convenience: Sec II. 22.1. vii)\tIn the event of such termination, payments to Dolphin included remuneration for any Work already performed (Sec II. 22.2) plus loss of remuneration to the extent prescribed by Sec III. 2.8.  viii)\tThe Operating Rate was $410,000 per day: Sec III. 2.1. ix)\tSpecified upgrades and modifications were to be made by Dolphin prior to the Commencement Date for which BP was to contribute 50%: Sec III. 3.2: Amendment No 1 added a provision that this contribution was to be payable by way of a supplement to the Operating Rate: Sec III. 3.2.1. x)\tAll other activity to be undertaken by Dolphin prior to the Commencement Date was set out in Sec IV. The impact of termination The rate of $410,000 per day agreed in September 2008 and subsequently adopted for the contract is no doubt well above present market rates in the wake of the financial crisis that emerged in the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009.  Indeed Dolphin contend that it may well be that no alternative work is now available.  Pending BP\'s decision on termination it is planned by Dolphin that the rig should be brought inshore to undertake or complete the upgrade programme as specified in the Contract.  \r   It can be readily appreciated that the financial implications of an early termination are very considerable from both parties\' point of view.  It is common ground that in the event of contractual termination immediately after the "Commencement Date" BP would be required to pay 90% of the operating rate less any mitigation in the form of other work or saved expenses for the entire three year period.  The exposure would thus be a substantial sum.  By the same token any liability for repudiatory breach arising from any earlier termination would be equally extensive.  But it is BP\'s case that the contractual provisions allow termination at any time prior to the Commencement Date without any liability on their part for any loss of profit thereafter. \r   The primary issue The particular provisions in contention are Clause 22(1)(a) and 22.2 of Section II and Clause 2.8(b) a of Section III.  As is no doubt apparent from this introduction it is BP\'s contention in summary that:\r   i)\tBP is entitled to terminate the Contract at any time and at its convenience: Sec II. 22.1(a). ii)\tThe amounts payable by BP in such event are the upgrade costs plus any termination fee prescribed in Section III: Sec II. 22.2(a).  iii)\tThe termination fee does not include any loss of profit payment: this is only payable if the Termination is after the Commencement Date: Sec III. 2.8(b).  iv)\tThe Commencement Date has yet to occur since it is the date where Dolphin has informed BP that the rig is ready (and indeed when the rig is under tow to the first well): Sec I. 5. In response Dolphin in short submits that this outcome is commercially absurd and irrational.  In the result Sec II.22.1(a) must be construed in such a manner that the right of termination is only exercisable after the Commencement Date. [1]   In particular:\r   i)\tAny other construction would afford BP a "call option" for the rig exercisable right up to the time when the drill is taken in tow without payment of any premium; ii)\tIn contrast Dolphin will have been constrained from seeking any work which would conflict with the commitment to BP as from September 2008 or at least from March 2009. iii)\tDespite the special condition relating to payment of a termination fee in the event of termination at BP\'s convenience, in reality termination could be effected prior to the Commencement Date without any payment or "termination fee" at all;   iv)\tIndeed the upgrade works were to be paid for by a supplement to the hire and there was no other work to be paid for prior to the Commencement Date. v)\tSince Work as defined could only be undertaken after the Commencement Date, this supported the construction that the Contract for the purposes of Sec II. 21.1 was simply the agreement as from the Commencement Date. vi)\tThis was confirmed by the manner of calculation of the figure for loss of earnings "during the initial 12 months of the Contract": Sec III. 2.8 b) a. The law I was inevitably reminded of the decision of the House of Lords in  Chartbrook v Persimmon Homes Ltd  [2009] 3 WLR 267   as regards the principles to be adopted in construing a contract.  The essence of the decision is as follows:\r   i)\tThe essential question is what a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would have been available to the parties would have understood them to be using the language of the contract to mean. ii)\tIf the Court was to depart from the ordinary meaning of the language used, it must be satisfied that something must have gone wrong with the language and linguistic mistakes are not readily or easily established in a formal document. iii)\tThe mere fact that a contract may appear to be unduly favourable to one of the parties is not a sufficient reason to conclude that there has been a linguistic mistake.  iv)\tWhere however the ordinary meaning of the words makes no commercial sense or appears arbitrary or irrational but can be understood in a rational way, that meaning is to be accepted. v)\tIn short, it should be clear that something has gone wrong with the language but also clear what a reasonable person would have understood the parties to have meant. It may well be that difficulties of construction do not call for the court to formulate some alternative form of words.  "What is clear from the cases is that there is not, so to speak, a limit on the amount of red ink or verbal rearrangement or correction which the court is allowed." per Lord Hoffman at para. 25.  Nonetheless if on the one hand the words used by the parties are straightforward (albeit giving rise to a harsh outcome in the circumstances that have arisen) and on the other hand it is difficult to reformulate the relevant provision in a manner which avoids that harsh result, the Court will be the more ready to accept that commercial parties, with their competing interests feeding the negotiations, meant exactly what they said.  \r   Discussion The starting point is Sec II. 22.(1).  As already explained it is Dolphin\'s case that, solely as regards the entitlement to terminate at "the convenience" of BP, it is clear that something has gone wrong with the language and that a reasonable person would have understood the parties to mean that it was subject in effect to an implicit proviso that this entitlement could only be exercised after the Commencement Date.  There are in my judgment a number of difficulties with this submission.\r   At the outset, Sec II. 22 is largely derived, word for word, from the industry\'s standard LOGIC Conditions of Contract Edition 1 which has been in effect as from December 1997.  This fact, taken with the experience of the oil and gas industry in making use of the conditions over the last 12 years, greatly undermines the suggestion that an open ended liberty to terminate at the convenience of the charterer both before and after the commencement of the drilling operations makes no commercial sense.  Indeed, it is clear that representatives from all quarters of the industry were on the drafting and review committee. \r   Notably the clause allows for termination in a number of other circumstances, some of which were as likely to emerge before drilling commenced as after e.g. bankruptcy of the contractor or total loss of the rig.  Yet it is accepted by Dolphin that no limitation on the right to terminate to a period after commencement of drilling applies in these cases.  This is clearly a realistic concession.  Indeed some events can only occur before commencement of drilling: e.g. failure to provide the rig ready for drilling.\r   It follows from that concession that only sub-clause (a) is subject to the suggested limitation on the exercise of the right of termination until after commencement of drilling.  This is despite the fact that all the specified reasons are introduced by the same phrase and no reference is made to the Commencement Date as defined in the sub-clause.  Put another way, it remains common ground that the Contract referred to in the introduction to Sec II. 21(1) is, as regards reasons (b) to (h), the terms and conditions of the written agreement applicable from the Effective Date (i.e. 23 March 2009).  Yet so far as reason (a) is concerned, it is submitted by Dolphin that termination is only available after the Commencement Date.  This in effect requires the Contract to be construed in two different senses: one as the agreement in force as from the Effective Date and the other as the agreement in force as from the Commencement Date.  In my judgment this is difficult to reconcile with a right to terminate the contract at such time as BP may consider necessary "for all the following reasons".  \r   Dolphin places emphasis on a number of further points said to be in conflict with this analysis which is categorised as being too literal.  At the forefront it is contended that it fails to give effect in any meaningful sense to the amendment to Sec II. 22.2(a) which introduced a termination fee specifically as regards termination under Sec II. 22.1(a).  It was submitted the suggested outcome was irrational since no such fee was payable under Sec III. 2.8 for termination prior to the Commencement Date.  This was all the more striking, it was contended, given the express precedence given to special conditions in Sec I. 2.\r   Even if this contrast was made out, I am not persuaded that it is particularly telling.  The provision can simply be understood as providing for payment of a termination fee if the preconditions are satisfied.  In any event, the point is not made out.  The termination fee is made up of two parts.  Whilst no claim in respect of the Operating Rate could be made, Sec III. 2.8(a) requires payment of any unpaid monies for Work performed up to the date of termination.  Such in my judgment would for instance include sums due in respect of any upgrade work undertaken prior to the Commencement Date: Sec IV 6.10.2.   Leaving that aside there are in addition a number of items of potential expenditure on the part of Dolphin prior to the Commencement Date for which reimbursement might be due from BP: e.g. accommodation of BP employees: Sec III 3.1,  training costs: Sec III 3.4,  handling and storage : Sec III 3.5 and Sec IV 7.2,  additional equipment : Sec IV 6.10.1\r   Dolphin challenges this analysis on the basis that the word "Work" is a defined term referable only to activity after the Commencement Date.  The source of this argument is the definition in Sec II 1.15 (as taken from the Standard Conditions):\r   ""WORK" shall mean all work conducted on the UKCS which the Contractor is required to carry out in accordance with the Contract". For this purpose "UKCS" means the United Kingdom Continental Shelf: Sec II 1.12.  This was reinforced by those provisions which suggested a distinction between "Work" and "work": see e.g. Sec I 5 and Sec III 3.2.1  Thus the argument ran the termination fee was only by reference to Work carried out after the Commencement Date.  In my judgment this approach cannot survive the express provisions of Sec IV which covers the scope of the "Work" to be furnished under the terms of the Contract which includes not only the modifications and upgrades (which by definition had to be completed before the Commencement Date) but a number of other steps expressly required to be taken prior to that date such as documentation and  inspection.\r   Indeed the definition Work derived from the Standard Conditions has to be read in the context of the special provisions in Sec IV including in particular Sec IV. 1:\r   "1.1  The Contractor shall provide the Drilling Unit to carry out the Work as generally described herein, according to the programmes and instructions issued from time to time by the company and/or the company Representatives.  .... "1.3  The Work which is to be provided by the Contract shall comprise but is not necessarily limited to the provision of management, engineering, supervisor, labour, plant, equipment and material at onshore and offshore locations to support the Company\'s operation, all as generally described herein." It is clear from this that the parties had enlarged the scope of the Work beyond that merely on the continental shelf.  In my judgment it included all activities required under the Contract whether before or after the Completion Date, including as I have already observed the specified modifications and upgrade.\r   It was not entirely clear whether Dolphin was submitting that Work for the purposes of the remaining reasons itemised in Sec II. 22.1 is similarly restricted to activities after the Completion Date.  But it would be surprising if BP could not terminate the upgrade or modifications in the face of say force majeure but only the contract as a whole.  \r   In any event, even if the Work is restricted to activities after the Commencement Date as suggested, it does not directly help in determining the meaning of the Contract, not least because Dolphin unquestionably does contend for a special meaning of the word as regards reason (a) alone. As regards termination for any other reason it was common ground that the Contract meant the agreement applicable as from the Effective Date. \r   This argument was advanced primarily by reference to the provision for a Termination Fee based on unpaid remuneration:\r   "2.8.(b)(a) For termination after the Commencement Date and during initial 12 months of Contract\xc2\x85" A similar point was made by reference to the defined duration of the Contract being 36 months from the Commencement Date: Sec I. 6.  This demonstrated, it was submitted, that the parties regarded the Contract as variously meaning the overall agreement or alternatively the three year agreement running as from the Commencement Date. The difficulty with this proposition is that it requires the word Contract in Sec II. 22. 1 to mean two different things at the same time.  In any event, Section I expressly provides that the terms of the Contract shall apply from the Effective Date.  This is in contra-distinction to the Commencement Date.  The Contract has to be read as a whole.  For instance the dispute resolution clause in the Standard Conditions governs any dispute arising out of the Contract or the Work: Clause 27.1.  This must include disputes arising from events prior to the Commencement Date.  In my judgment, there is little support for any different construction to be derived from the reference in Sec III. 2.8 to the "initial 12 months of the Contract".  It is simply descriptive of the 12 month period of the Contract after the Commencement Date.\r   The overall analysis is not undermined by the implementation of the special provision as regards payment for modifications and additional equipment provided for by Sec III. 3.2.1.  In saying this I have not forgotten the proposition advanced by Dolphin that BP is wrong in accepting responsibility of its share of costs incurred in undertaking any modifications to the rig in the event of early termination since the parties have agreed that it should be recovered by supplement to the hire.  It is right that a supplemental rate is premised on the continuation of the contract throughout the three year period after the Commencement Date.  But I regard the point as neutral in the sense that it does not assist one way or another as regards the meaning of Work let alone Contract.  Even if well founded it is simply a reflection of the facts of the case. \r   But in any event, if it matters, I am not presently persuaded that the proposition is well founded. The contract must be read as a whole.  Given the wide range of reasons for termination the parties must be viewed as intending that on termination costs incurred would be recoverable on the alternative basis of a lump sum even if a supplement to the hire rate had been agreed.\r   Conclusion The issue comes full circle to the proposition that BP\'s construction gives rise to a commercial absurdity and thus something must have gone wrong with the language of Section II. 22(1)(a).  I am not persuaded that such is the case let alone clearly so.  \r   The outcome (in the aftermath of an unexpected financial crisis) may be highly unattractive from Dolphin\'s perspective.  But it arises from a standard term.  The usual financial implications of BP\'s right to terminate at its convenience up and until the Commencement Date may well have been a valuable option reflected in the Operating Rate.  The value of the option may not have been fully appreciated given the extreme nature of the business downturn.  But it is not suggested that BP acted other than bone fide in regard to their presently asserted convenience.  In my judgment whether the motivation for termination is the fall in the market on the one hand or, say, the absence of drilling opportunities in the designated area on the other, it is not made out that the consequences are commercially absurd.\r   It may be severe in the circumstances that have arisen but in my judgment Dolphin has fallen a long way short of establishing that something had gone wrong with the language let alone establishing otherwise what a reasonable person would regard the parties as having meant by the terms of Sec II. 22.\r   For all those reasons I conclude that BP is entitled to the declarations sought. \xc2\xa0   CONFORMED CONTRACT    between   BP EXPLORATION OPERATING COMPANY LIMITED   and   Dolphin Drilling   For the provision and operation of the Byford Dolphin, Semi-Submersible Drilling Rig   SECTION I: FORM OF AGREEMENT [2] This CONTRACT is made between the following parties:- BP Exploration Operating Company Limited a company formed under the laws of England, registered number 305943, and having its registered office at Chertsey Road, Sunbury upon Thames, Middlesex, TW16 7BP. hereinafter called the COMPANY, and Dolphin Drilling Ltd. a company formed under the laws of England, Registered number: 1017650, and having its registered office at Kings Scholars House, 230 Vauxhall Bridge Road, London SW1V 1AU hereinafter called the CONTRACTOR.

The Sections shall be read as one document, the contents of which, in the event of ambiguity or contradiction between Sections, shall be given precedence in the order listed, with the exception that the Special Conditions of Contract shall take precedence over the General Conditions of Contract. 3) In accordance with the terms and conditions of the CONTRACT, the CONTRACTOR shall perform and complete the WORK and the COMPANY shall pay the CONTRACT PRICE. 4) The terms and conditions of the CONTRACT shall apply from [ 23 March 2009 ], which shall be the EFFECTIVE DATE. 5) The COMMENCEMENT DATE shall be: [4] after all rig audit actions are closed to COMPANY\'S satisfaction and equipment detailed on the rig equipment list including all equipment detailed under Clause 3.2 of Section III of the CONTRACT [5]  is fit for purpose and where applicable approved and tested to manufacturers specification and in direct continuation following DRILLING UNIT\'S five year Special Periodic Survey (SPS) which is scheduled to commence first quarter 2010. Subject to finalization of the SPS work scope, CONTRACTOR shall make all reasonable efforts to complete the SPS within the first quarter of 2010. The exact COMMENCEMENT DATE shall be the date and time when CONTRACTOR has informed COMPANY that the DRILLING UNIT is ready to be mobilised to COMPANY\'S first well location and the DRILLING UNIT has been accepted by COMPANY in accordance with a mutually agreed acceptance testing procedure and the DRILLING UNIT is under tight tow to the first location under this CONTRACT. The COMMENCEMENT DATE shall be no earlier than the 1 st  day of January 2010 and no later than the 31 s \' day of March 2010. CONTRACTOR shall apply best endeavours to contract and manage the preceding work to ensure the UNIT is available to commence WORK during the aforementioned timeline. In the event that the COMMENCEMENT DATE is delayed beyond the 31 st  day of March 2010 the following discounts shall be applied; 11 to 20 days after the 31 s \' day of March 2010 a 20% discount to the Operating rate shall be applied 21 to 30 days after the 31 SI  day of March 2010 a 25% discount to the Operating rate shall be applied. 31 to 60 days after the 31 sl  day of March 2010 a 50% discount to the Operating rate shall be applied. The aforementioned discount rates shall be applied to the days immediately following the COMMENCEMENT DATE. So, for the avoidance of doubt, if the DRILLING UNIT arrives 15 days after the 31 st  day of March 2010 the Contractor shall reduce the first five days Operating rate by 20%. [6] 6) \tThe duration of the CONTRACT shall be:  [7] for a period of Thirty Six (36) months from the COMMENCEMENT DATE unless terminated pursuant to the provisions of Clause 22 of Section II (a) - CRTNE General Conditions of Contract.

In the event that CONTRACTOR does not agree to commencement of a new well the contract will cease upon conclusion of the final well in progress and in accordance with clause 7. In the event of non productive time as a result of non performance by CONTRACTOR GROUP and/or as a result of unplanned or planned ship yard visits and/or extended repair time, during which time Nil Rate is applicable, COMPANY shall have the option to extend the length of CONTRACT to correspond to the time lost as detailed below: a)    Total time lost during the first 24 months of operation to be exercised in one extension prior to the end of the 25* (twenty fifth) month. b)   Total time lost between the 25 th  month and the 33 rd  month of operation to be exercised in one extension prior to the end of the 34 th  (thirty fourth) month. " The DRILLING UNIT shall be "on hire" to the COMPANY from the COMMENCEMENT DATE until the COMPLETION DATE. The COMPANY shall use the DRILLING UNIT to perform a programme appraisal, development and abandonment operations in the UKCS Central and Northern North Sea. [8] 7) The COMPLETION DATE ...  [9] . .. shall mean the time and date when the DRILLING UNIT is under tight tow to the next operator\'s location and is five hundred (500) metres from the last COMPANY location or, in the event that the DRILLING UNIT does not have work in direct continuation of its current WORK, at the date and time the DRILLING UNIT is safely moored at a sheltered inshore location as specified by the CONTRACTOR, such location to be no further distant from the last location on which the COMPANY uses the DRILLING UNIT than Invergordon ("the Demobilisation port"). COMPANY shall endeavour to demobilise COMPANY\'S and its other contractors\' equipment and personnel prior to or upon achievement of the COMPLETION DATE. Where there are likely to be delays in demobilisation of equipment or personnel, COMPANY and CONTRACTOR shall mutually agree timing for demobilization of such  [10] 8) The authorised representatives of the parties have executed the CONTRACT in duplicate upon the dates indicated below: SECTION II(a): LOGIC GENERAL CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT The General Conditions of the CONTRACT shall be the LOGIC General Conditions of Contract for Mobile Drilling Rigs (Edition 1 \xc2\x96 December 1997), Copies of which are deemed to be in the possession of both the COMPANY and the CONTRACTOR.
