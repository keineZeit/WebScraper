b'MR JUSTICE HAMBLEN:   \tThis is an application by the\xc2\xa0claimant bank to vary the\xc2\xa0receivership order made in relation to Mr\xc2\xa0Ablyazov\'s assets on 6\xc2\xa0August\xc2\xa02010 so as to permit the\xc2\xa0receivers to sell three properties.\r\n   \tThose three properties are:\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0mansion on the Bishop\'s\xc2\xa0Avenue in North London known as Carlton\xc2\xa0House; a\xc2\xa0100-acre estate near Windsor known as Oaklands\xc2\xa0Park; and an apartment in St\xc2\xa0John\'s\xc2\xa0Wood known as Albert\'s\xc2\xa0Court.  \r\n   \tIn summary, the bank says it\xc2\xa0is appropriate to make such an order because Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Teare has found to the\xc2\xa0criminal standard that the\xc2\xa0properties belong to Mr\xc2\xa0Ablyazov.  A\xc2\xa0judgment has now been entered against Mr\xc2\xa0Ablyazov in an amount exceeding US$3.6\xc2\xa0billion.  Mr\xc2\xa0Ablyazov\'s application for permission to appeal to the\xc2\xa0Supreme Court has been dismissed.  The receivers have been appointed in relation to the properties for a\xc2\xa0considerable time, have taken a\xc2\xa0number of steps in relation to them and are in the\xc2\xa0best position to organise their sale and, at least in relation to one of the properties, the\xc2\xa0bank is having to pay\xc2\xa0very substantial ongoing maintenance charges.\r\n   \tI shall consider each of the\xc2\xa0properties to which I\xc2\xa0have referred in turn.\r\n   \tFirst, Carlton\xc2\xa0House - this was purchased on 26 April 2006 for the\xc2\xa0sum of GBP15.5\xc2\xa0million.  The\xc2\xa0registered proprietor of Carlton\xc2\xa0House is Mount\xc2\xa0Properties.  But it has been found to the criminal standard by Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Teare that:\r\n   "I\xc2\xa0am persuaded so that I\xc2\xa0am sure that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the circumstantial evidence is that Mr\xc2\xa0Ablyazov was the beneficial owner of the shares in Mount Properties and hence the\xc2\xa0beneficial owner of Carlton\xc2\xa0House." \tIt had been alleged by Mr\xc2\xa0Ablyazov that Carlton\xc2\xa0House in fact belonged to his brother-in-law, Syrym\xc2\xa0Shalabayev.  This contention was rejected by the\xc2\xa0court and, in that regard, the judge\'s finding was upheld by the\xc2\xa0Court of Appeal- see in particular the\xc2\xa0judgment of Lord\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Rix at paragraph\xc2\xa084.\r\n   \tAfter the\xc2\xa0trial before Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Teare had concluded but before judgment was handed down there was a\xc2\xa0further witness statement provided by Mr\xc2\xa0Shalabayev which suggested that an individual called Roland\xc2\xa0Koefer was claiming beneficial ownership of the\xc2\xa0shares in Mount\xc2\xa0Properties.  \r\n   \tMr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Teare\'s conclusion was:\r\n   "I\xc2\xa0do not consider the\xc2\xa0claim to be true that Roland\xc2\xa0Koefer may have purchased Carlton\xc2\xa0House from Syrym\xc2\xa0Shalabayev in November 2002."  This finding was again upheld by the\xc2\xa0Court of Appeal.      Lord\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Rix observed at paragraph\xc2\xa097 as follows:\r\n   "In the\xc2\xa0case of Carlton\xc2\xa0House and Oaklands\xc2\xa0Park, sumptuous homes which Mr\xc2\xa0Ablyazov and his family enjoyed, when they became the\xc2\xa0focus of attention in committal proceedings, the\xc2\xa0court was asked to believe that not Mr\xc2\xa0Ablyazov, but his brother-in-law, Syrym\xc2\xa0Shalabayev, was the owner by virtue of his success in the\xc2\xa0uranium business, a\xc2\xa0success not only entirely undocumented, but contradicted by documents and unmentioned by Mr\xc2\xa0Ablyazov when he was setting out his original account of Syrym\'s business career.   Moreover, when the\xc2\xa0point was made at trial that Syrym\'s alleged sales of these properties to third parties went unevidenced, despite the\xc2\xa0receivership orders against the\xc2\xa0companies concerned and notes placed on the\xc2\xa0Land Registry, mysterious buyers subsequently to trial belatedly emerged making themselves known not in England, but in Cyprus, but otherwise strangely quiescent as to the\xc2\xa0disaster by which their otherwise highly valuable properties have become embroiled in English proceedings."  The\xc2\xa0evidence is that since that time no steps have been taken by Mr\xc2\xa0Koefer to seek resolution of the application made to the\xc2\xa0Cypriot court.  The\xc2\xa0evidence is that the most recent valuation obtained by the receivers in relation to Carlton\xc2\xa0House is in the\xc2\xa0amount of GBP13.5\xc2\xa0million to GBP15\xc2\xa0million.\r\n   \tSecondly, Oaklands\xc2\xa0Park - Oaklands\xc2\xa0Park\'s registered proprietor is Lafe Technologies Limited, a\xc2\xa0company incorporated in the Seychelles.  The\xc2\xa0shares in Lafe were purchased for \xc2\xa318.15\xc2\xa0million.  This was a\xc2\xa0property used by Mr\xc2\xa0Ablyazov and members of his family.  \r\n   \tThe\xc2\xa0finding of Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Teare in the contempt hearing in relation to this property was:\r\n   "I\xc2\xa0am persuaded so that I\xc2\xa0am sure that Mr\xc2\xa0Ablyazov is the\xc2\xa0beneficial owner of the\xc2\xa0shares in Lafe and, hence, Oaklands\xc2\xa0Park.  My reasons are essentially the same as found in my decision in relation to Carlton\xc2\xa0House." \tThis is a\xc2\xa0property which the\xc2\xa0receivers have been unable to let and are having to pay out costs of approximately \xc2\xa324,000 per month to maintain.  Again there was\xc2\xa0an application made in proceedings in Cyprus in relation to the\xc2\xa0shares in the\xc2\xa0only company, this time by a\xc2\xa0Mrs\xc2\xa0Beaud.  The\xc2\xa0comments of Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Teare and Lord\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Rix equally apply to her role and, again, she has taken no further steps to seek resolution of the application before the Cypriot court.\r\n   \tThe\xc2\xa0most recent valuation obtained in relation to Oaklands\xc2\xa0Park is in the amount of GBP20\xc2\xa0million to GBP25\xc2\xa0million.\r\n   \tThirdly, Albert\'s\xc2\xa0Court \xc2\x96 this is a\xc2\xa0second-floor flat in the Palgrave\xc2\xa0Gardens Estate in St\xc2\xa0John\'s\xc2\xa0Wood.  Its registered proprietor is Bensborough\xc2\xa0Trading Inc.  It was purchased on 27\xc2\xa0June\xc2\xa02008 for \xc2\xa3965,000.  \r\n   \tMr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Teare\'s finding in relation to Albert\'s\xc2\xa0Court was:\r\n   "I\xc2\xa0am persuaded so that I\xc2\xa0am sure that the\xc2\xa0only reasonable inference to be drawn from the\xc2\xa0evidence is that Mr\xc2\xa0Ablyazov was the\xc2\xa0beneficial owner of Albert\'s\xc2\xa0Court." \tThe\xc2\xa0bank seeks, as part of the\xc2\xa0variation of the\xc2\xa0receivership order, an order that the\xc2\xa0receivers take over as receivers and managers of Bensborough\xc2\xa0Trading in the\xc2\xa0same way as they have in relation to Mount\xc2\xa0Properties Limited and Lafe\xc2\xa0Technology. \r\n   \tI\xc2\xa0am persuaded that it\xc2\xa0is appropriate that the order be varied in that way.  \r\n   \tIn relation to the\xc2\xa0variation seeking the\xc2\xa0inclusion of powers of sale, the\xc2\xa0bank submits that the\xc2\xa0court has jurisdiction to make an order in these terms.  \r\n   \tReference is made firstly to section\xc2\xa037.1 of the Senior Courts Act 1981 and the\xc2\xa0court\'s general power in relation to the\xc2\xa0appointment of a\xc2\xa0receiver and to act according to what is just and convenient.  \r\n   \tReference is also made to section\xc2\xa037.4 which confers a\xc2\xa0specific power on the court to appoint a\xc2\xa0receiver by way of equitable execution.  In this connection, I\xc2\xa0have been referred to Kerr\xc2\xa0&\xc2\xa0Hunter on Receivers and Administrators at paragraph\xc2\xa03-13 where reference is made to the\xc2\xa0power under section\xc2\xa037.4.  \r\n   \tIt\xc2\xa0is also pointed out in relation to equitable principles governing the\xc2\xa0circumstances in which equitable execution may be available, that those principles do not apply in their full rigour where a\xc2\xa0judgment debtor is threatening or intending to deal with property in a\xc2\xa0manner which may amount to a fraudulent attempt to defeat the rights of creditors.  In that connection, reference is made to the\xc2\xa0case of Manchester and Liverpool District Banking Company v Parkinson [1888] 20 QEB 173, and Goldschmidt v Oberrheinische Metalworker [1906] 1 KB 373.\r\n   \tAside from section\xc2\xa037.1 and section\xc2\xa037.4, the\xc2\xa0bank further submits that the\xc2\xa0Chancery principles which restricted the\xc2\xa0exercise of the\xc2\xa0court\'s powers of equitable execution have developed and are no longer subject to restrictions suggested by some of the older case law.  In this connection, I\xc2\xa0was referred to Gee on Commercial Injunctions, paragraph\xc2\xa016.09 to 16.011.\r\n   \tThere, Gee explains as follows:\r\n   "The\xc2\xa0effect of the emergence of the Mareva jurisdiction has been the\xc2\xa0recognition of a\xc2\xa0jurisdiction, available before and after judgment, to grant an injunction or appoint a\xc2\xa0receiver for the\xc2\xa0purpose of preserving assets of a\xc2\xa0defendant.  The appointment of a receiver involves the court through its officer, the\xc2\xa0receiver, taking control of the\xc2\xa0relevant assets.  It\xc2\xa0is only a\xc2\xa0short step post-judgment for the court to order the assets controlled by the receiver to be used to satisfy the\xc2\xa0judgment.  A\xc2\xa0receiver appointed to preserve assets of the\xc2\xa0defendant pending judgment in the\xc2\xa0action may in due course become the means for satisfying the\xc2\xa0judgment.  Similarly, post-judgment, if a\xc2\xa0receiver is appointed to preserve assets, then in principle the\xc2\xa0assets which he protects ought to be available to satisfy the\xc2\xa0judgment.   These considerations show that in deciding whether to appoint a\xc2\xa0receiver post-judgment the\xc2\xa0court should take into account whether, unless the\xc2\xa0appointment is made, the\xc2\xa0relevant assets are liable to be dissipated, and the\xc2\xa0limits of \'equitable execution\' as operated by the former High Court of Chancery are no longer determinative.  Instead the\xc2\xa0court should proceed in each case on the basis that section a\xc2\xa07 confers on it a jurisdiction to make the\xc2\xa0appointment, but there remains a\xc2\xa0question of discretion, which will be exercised flexibly, taking into account all the\xc2\xa0circumstances of the case, including practical convenience, avoiding unnecessary delay, cost or expense, and considering whether the appointment is likely to provide the claimant with satisfaction of his judgment." \tThe\xc2\xa0bank urges the\xc2\xa0court to follow that approach and submits that all those reasons apply here as to why the\xc2\xa0receivership order should be extended to cover a\xc2\xa0private sale.\r\n   \tIn support of a\xc2\xa0more flexible modern approach, I\xc2\xa0was referred to Soinco SACI v Novokuznetsk Aluminium Plant [1998] QB 406, Masri v Consolidated Contractors Int (UK) Limited (Number\xc2\xa02)  [2009] QB 450  and TMSF\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Merrill\xc2\xa0Lynch Bank and Trust Co Limited  [2012] 1 WLR 1721 .  \r\n   \tIn this case the\xc2\xa0bank submits that the\xc2\xa0circumstances of the case, including practical convenience, avoiding delay, cost and expense and considering whether satisfaction for judgment may be achieved all point to varying the receivership order to include a\xc2\xa0power of sale.  \r\n   \tIn particular, it\xc2\xa0is pointed out that the\xc2\xa0receivers are already in office; that the\xc2\xa0receivers already have a\xc2\xa0substantial knowledge of the properties; that they will be in a\xc2\xa0position to proceed more quickly in terms of marketing and sale than following through the\xc2\xa0formal procedures of a\xc2\xa0charging order; that the\xc2\xa0receivers are already receivers and managers of Mount\xc2\xa0Properties Limited and of Lafe\xc2\xa0Technology Limited and by the\xc2\xa0terms of the order I\xc2\xa0shall be making, Bensborough\xc2\xa0Trading\xc2\xa0Inc as well; and that the\xc2\xa0receivers will be able to use their powers to transfer and sell the properties without the bank needing to make Part\xc2\xa08 claim seeking order for\xc2\xa0sale, without the\xc2\xa0need for the court to vest in the bank a legal term of 3,000\xc2\xa0years in the properties to be sold and without the\xc2\xa0appointment of a representative of the\xc2\xa0bank or a\xc2\xa0bank solicitor as a\xc2\xa0person to sell the\xc2\xa0properties.\r\n   \tIt\xc2\xa0is pointed out that enabling the\xc2\xa0receivers to have the\xc2\xa0power of sale rather than going through the\xc2\xa0charging order procedure will in fact give the\xc2\xa0court greater control over the\xc2\xa0process because the\xc2\xa0receivers remain accountable to the\xc2\xa0court.  It will also avoid any arguments about any dual role because if, for example pursuant to a\xc2\xa0charging order, the\xc2\xa0sale of the properties was entrusted to the\xc2\xa0receiver, there might be arguments as to the\xc2\xa0fact that in those circumstances the\xc2\xa0receiver would be acting on behalf of the bank.  It would accordingly be more satisfactory for all matters of sale to be dealt with by the\xc2\xa0receiver in the\xc2\xa0context of the\xc2\xa0existing receivership order and their duties to the\xc2\xa0court.\r\n   \tI\xc2\xa0accept the\xc2\xa0bank\'s submission, which is broadly supported by the\xc2\xa0receivers, that, for the\xc2\xa0reasons I\xc2\xa0have outlined and in light of the authorities to which I\xc2\xa0have referred, this is an appropriate case for the\xc2\xa0court to take the\xc2\xa0further step of enabling the\xc2\xa0receivership order to encompass the\xc2\xa0power of sale which is sought.  \r\n   \tThe\xc2\xa0receivers have made it clear that no sale will be carried out until there is a\xc2\xa0final charging order.  There is at present an interim order and a\xc2\xa0hearing that is due to take place in relation to making that order a\xc2\xa0final order in respect of all three properties.  I\xc2\xa0consider that that should also be included in the\xc2\xa0draft order.  I\xc2\xa0am satisfied that I\xc2\xa0have jurisdiction to make this order and in the exercise of my discretion it is an\xc2\xa0appropriate case, to make the\xc2\xa0order sought.\r\n   \tI\xc2\xa0also accept the\xc2\xa0submission made by the\xc2\xa0bank and also receivers that it would be appropriate to make an order under CPR rule 19.8A, which is a\xc2\xa0rule that gives a\xc2\xa0power to make judgments binding on non-parties, and I\xc2\xa0make the\xc2\xa0order in the\xc2\xa0draft terms which have been put before the\xc2\xa0court as amended orally during submissions. \r\n   \tI\xc2\xa0should add that notice of this application has been given, not just to Mr\xc2\xa0Ablyazov, but to all other interested parties.\r\n   '
