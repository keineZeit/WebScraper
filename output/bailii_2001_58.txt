b'Mr Justice Thomas:   There is before the court an application for judgment under CPR Part 24.  The action was brought by the Claimants (the Sellers) against the Defendants (the Buyers) in respect of a contract for the sale of low sulphur fuel oil contained in a telex dated 20 November 2000 and an associated agreement made in January 2001.\n   Under the contract of 20 November 2000, the Buyers agreed to buy 9,000 \xc2\x96 10,000 tons of low sulphur fuel oil. The contract set out  the specification of the oil, but it is only necessary to refer to the pour point as it was that part of the specification that gave rise to the dispute; it provided:\n   \xc2\x93Low sulphur fuel oil of EU origin with the following actual specifications as tested at loadport: PROPERTIES\t\tPROPERTY UNIT\tRESULTS FINAL \xc2\x85   \t\tPour Point\t\tDeg C\t\t\t- 3 \t\t\xc2\x85 \t\tAnd with the following guaranteed specifications at disport: \t\tPour Point\t\tDeg C\t\t\t+ 3 Max This clause constitutes the whole seller\xc2\x92s obligations with respect to the quality of the product to be supplied\xc2\x85\xc2\x94 The price was to be paid \xc2\x93without deduction, offset or counterclaim\xc2\x94.  Clause 8 of the contract provided as follows:\n   \xc2\x938.\tDETERMINATION OF QUANTITY/QUALITY: -  Quantity as per outturn quantity as checked by Messrs Saybolt Independent Inspectors. -\t    Quality as ascertained at loading installation to be final and binding for both parties except for pour point, sulphur and net calorific value to be retested at disport on the basis of a ship\xc2\x92s composite sample taken before discharge by Messrs Saybolt Independent Inspectors whose results to be final and binding for both parties save fraud or manifest error. Inspections costs at disport to be equally shared between Buyer and Seller. \xc2\x94 \tThe contract also provided for jurisdiction in the following terms in clause 11: \xc2\x93This contract is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England.  The parties hereto irrevocably agree that the High Courts of England are to have jurisdiction to settle any dispute which may arise out of or in connection with this contract and submit to the jurisdiction of those courts.\xc2\x94  The delivery of the cargo A cargo of 28,600 mt of Low Sulphur fuel oil was loaded at Tarragona, Spain on the   Adriatiki   on 15 November 2000 by Repsol SA. (Repsol); it was in two parcels \xc2\x96 one of 10,600 mt and one of 18,000 mt. It came from a single shore tank (save for 400 mt). A certificate was provided by Repsol showing the pour point at Tarragona was -3\xc2\xb0C as tested by test method ASTM D-97 from a sample taken from the shore tank.\n   The vessel discharged 9,790 mt at Malta on 18-19 November 2000 into the shore tanks of Oiltanking Malta Ltd.  The cargo that was discharged was tested by Saybolt Malta Ltd (Saybolt); they took a composite sample representing the parcel to be discharged at Malta from the ship\xc2\x92s tanks before discharge (sample A), a sample from shore tank 321 into which the parcel was discharged  (sample B) and a composite sample from all the ship\xc2\x92s tanks (sample C).  A certificate was issued which showed the results in the following terms:\n   \xc2\x93Sample submitted as\tFuel Oil Received\t\tSampled by Saybolt Inspector Marked\t(A)\tShip\xc2\x92s composite sample taken before discharge; representing the Malta parcel. \t(B)\tSingle tank composite sample taken ex ST 321 after discharge. \t(C)\tMultiple ship\xc2\x92s tanks composite sample taken on arrival of all cargo.

ASTM D 97\t\xc2\x94\t3\t3\t9(*) Remarks (*) Re-checked three times\xc2\x94 The dispute between the parties The course of subsequent events was a matter of dispute.\n   The oil was held initially in the tanks to the order of the Sellers by Oiltanking Malta Ltd. Subsequently, the Buyers took delivery of 3,999.7 mt, the price due to the Sellers being secured under letters of credit.  The Buyers transported that quantity in December 2000 to Augusta, Sicily on the   Cap Farina   and then by road to Messina; the Buyers claimed they had difficulty in transporting the oil because of the pour point; they had intended to ship it directly to Messina, but because of the pour point, that could not be done as the shore line was long and it had to be discharged at Augusta and sent on by road.\n   An agreement was made with the Sellers on 30 December 2000 and a further agreement replacing that was made on 18 January 2001. The Buyers had declined to accept the remainder of the cargo- 5,790mt; this was returned to the Sellers under the agreement of 18 January 2001 which provided that the Buyers pay a difference in price of $396,647.26 on 15 March 2001. The Sellers contended that this was a \xc2\x93wash-out\xc2\x94 of the sale and purchase obligations against payment of the agreed amount.  Subsequently the Buyers declined to pay this amount. They contended that the specification of the oil was not in accordance with the contract as regards the pour point; they claimed an abatement of the price and that they had suffered additional losses.\n   Under a further agreement made on the telephone on 18 January 2001, the Buyers also agreed to pay for the storage charges of the oil in the sum of $14,000.\n   The ship\xc2\x92s composite sample taken by Saybolt in November 2000 (sample A) was then re-tested by Saybolt on 25 April 2001 in the presence of the Buyers and Sellers in two ways; test (1) involved the original sample A prepared on 18 November 2000 and test (2) involved a new sample prepared on 25 April 2001 from the ship\xc2\x92s tanks representing the cargo discharged  at Malta ; the following results  for (1) and (2) were set out in a certificate dated 26 April 2001:\n   TEST\tUNIT\tMETHOD\t\tRESULTS \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1\t2 \xc2\x93Pour Point\t\tC\tASTM D97\t\t+6\t+12 Two further tests were also carried out:\n   On 11 January 2001 Saybolt analysed a sample from shoretank 323 in Malta; this contained the remainder of the cargo.   The certificate showed a pour point of +9\xc2\xb0C.\n On 28 February 2001 Agenzia Delle Dogane analysed the cargo taken to Sicily.  They certified that it had a pour point of +12\xc2\xb0C.\n The course of the proceedings Proceedings were issued by the Sellers on 22 March 2001 and a Part 24 application made on 24 April 2001. The primary basis of the application made was that there was no defence to the claim under the agreement of 18 January 2001. When the application came on for hearing, it became clear that it was not possible, on the evidence before the court, to determine whether the buyers had a real prospect of defending the claim made by the Sellers under the agreement of 18 January 2001; the Sellers claimed that they were entitled to succeed under that agreement whatever the outcome of the dispute was in relation to the pour point.\n   However all the available evidence for the purpose of a Part 24 application was before the court in relation to another question that arose \xc2\x96 whether the Buyers had a real prospect of successfully defending the claim by showing that the pour point of the cargo was not in accordance with the specification in the face of the Saybolt certificate of 22 November 2001.  There was a short issue on whether, under the terms of clause 8, the Buyers had a real prospect of success in showing that there was manifest error.  It was accepted by the Buyers that, if this issued was decided against them, then they were liable to the Sellers irrespective of the nature of the dispute over the agreement of 18 January 2001, as they would not be able to maintain their complaint in respect of the pour point of the cargo. \n   I decided therefore that it was appropriate to determine the second issue; if I decided that issue against the Sellers, then they were to be entitled to pursue their part 24 application under the agreement of 18 January 2001.\n   The applicable principles of the law Clause 8 provided that the re-test for the pour point at the discharge port by Saybolt was to be final and binding for both parties \xc2\x93save for fraud or manifest error\xc2\x94.\n   Although the term \xc2\x93manifest error\xc2\x94 is now not infrequently used in clauses relating to certification in contracts for the supply of oil, so far as the researches of counsel had gone there is no decided authority on the meaning of the term.  However the applicable principles were not seriously in dispute:\n   (i)\tIt is important for the operation of commerce that commercial men and bankers can rely upon the finality of a certificate: in   Toepfer v. Continental Grain Co.   [1974] 1 Lloyds Rep. 11.  Lord Denning put the position in the following terms: \xc2\x93Apart altogether from authority, I am clearly of the opinion that a mistake by the certifier, even when afterwards admitted by him to be a mistake, does not invalidate the certificate.  It remains binding as between seller and buyer all down the chain\xc2\x85 it must be remembered that numerous persons act on the faith of the certificate, such as buyer, sub-buyers, bankers lending money and so forth.  Good sense requires that the finality of the clause should be upheld by arbitrators and the Courts in full.\xc2\x94 (ii)\tEven if the certifier admits that he has made a mistake, the Court should uphold the finality of the certificate (see the passage quoted above). (iii)\tThe exception of manifest error should be construed in this commercial context. (iv)\t\xc2\x93Manifest\xc2\x94 meant in ordinary language \xc2\x93plain and obvious\xc2\x94. (v)\tThe manifest error must relate to the certificate or the procedure that led to the making of the certificate; for example it would be a manifest error if a plain and obvious mistake of transcription had been made or a plain and obvious error had been made in testing or in sampling or in mixing the samples. (vi)\tIn deciding whether there was a manifest error the Court should take into account the technical knowledge that parties would have about the testing procedure. The technical background \tThere was set out in a report by Mr Chell of London Offshore Consultants Limited, well known marine and engineering consultants, the relevant technical background; Mr Chell is an expert in fuel oil analysis and was formerly employed by Lloyd\xc2\x92s Fuel Oil Bunker and Advisory Services.  He explained that the standard test for pour point is ISO 3016 and it was the same method as ASTM D97 as used by Saybolt and Repsol.  The testing method involved heating a small sample of oil and then cooling it at a specified rate, while examining it at the 3\xc2\xb0C intervals for flow characteristics.  The pour point was quoted at 3\xc2\xb0C above the temperature at which no flow was observed.\n   Tests for pour point did not necessarily produce exactly the same results, but there were well recognised parameters within which tests could be compared; these were  termed \xc2\x93repeatability\xc2\x94 and \xc2\x93reproducibility\xc2\x94.  Repeatability was the closeness of test results of the same sample using the same test method and the same laboratory.  Reproducibility was the closeness of the test result of the same sample using the same test method but by a different laboratory.  The ASTM D97 test had a repeatability of \xc2\xb13\xc2\xb0C and reproducibility of \xc2\xb16\xc2\xb0C.\n   Mr Chell stated that the range for reproducibility explained the contractual specification; as-3\xc2\xb0C was specified at the loading port, then as the cargo would be tested at the discharge port by a different laboratory, then the specification had to allow for a variation in the pour point of \xc2\xb16\xc2\xb0C and so gave a maximum value at the discharge port of +3\xc2\xb0C.\n   He believed that the most likely explanation for the difference in test results was due to a blending problem; a possibility was that the fuel in the tank at Tarragona was a blend of more than one parcel each with a different pour point; if the parcels were not properly blended, then there could be layers of fuel with different pour points within the total parcel. The only way to determine this was to test each ship\xc2\x92s tank.  \n   The respective arguments Against this background the Buyers contended:\n   \t(1)\tThe range of tests primarily to be considered were those at Taragona carried out by Repsol and those carried out by Saybolt at Malta in November 2000. \t(2)\tAt Taragona the pour point was -3\xc2\xb0C; all the tests for the cargo at Malta should have been within the reproducibility of this \xc2\x96 ie. within \xc2\xb16\xc2\xb0C and within \xc2\xb13\xc2\xb0C of each other.  They were not - the Saybolt test as certified on 22 November 2000 for the whole cargo at Malta (sample C) was +9\xc2\xb0C; this was outside the reproducibility range applicable in respect of the Tarragona test and the repeatability range for the other tests at Malta.  There was an overall variation of 12\xc2\xb0C. If the samples tested in April were brought into account, then A as re-tested in April 2000 was +6\xc2\xb0C and the new sample made in April 2001 was + 12\xc2\xb0C. This showed a variation of 15\xc2\xb0C, well outside the acceptable range. \t(3)\tAlthough Mr Chell may have defined reproducibility as the closeness of the test results of the same sample using the same test methods but by a different laboratory, looking at his report as a whole it was clear that he considered: \t\t(a)\tThe tests at Malta should have all been in the repeatability range; they were of the same cargo. \t\t(b)\tThat there should not be such a large difference between Tarragona and Malta; it should not have exceeded the reproducibility range. (c)\tSaybolt were plainly in error as they re-tested one of the samples three times.   \tLooking at the figures on this basis, there was a plain and obvious error in the sampling or in the certificates. The Sellers\xc2\x92 contentions can be summarised as follows:\n   \t(1)\tIt was clear on the explanation given by Mr Chell that there was no error. \t(2)\tThe relevant samples were the composite sample from the ship\xc2\x92s tanks of the cargo to be discharged  \xc2\x96 Sample A as tested in November 2000 (3\xc2\xb0C) and April 2001 (6\xc2\xb0C).  The second test was within the repeatability range of  \xc2\xb13\xc2\xb0C. \t(3)\tThe only other test with which comparisons could possibly be made were the test at Tarragona and the other tests carried out by Saybolt in November and April; to those the range for reproducibility applied and all the tests were within \xc2\xb16\xc2\xb0C of the +3\xc2\xb0C result for Sample A.  \t(4)\tLooking at Mr Chell\xc2\x92s report as a whole he did not say that Saybolt had done anything wrong. Conclusion As was common ground, the question before the court was whether there was a real prospect of successfully defending the claim by showing that there was a plain and obvious error in relation to the certificate or the procedure leading to the making of the certificate.\n   If I was to consider the definition of repeatability and reproducibility given by Mr Chell, the tests of Sample A made in November 2000 and April 2001 were plainly within the range of repeatability. There was no error evidenced by the re-test, let alone any plain and obvious error. All the other tests at Malta were within the reproducibility range of sample A and thus no error could be inferred from such tests.\n   However, reading Mr Chell\xc2\x92s report as a whole and taking into account the fact that this is a Part 24 application, I accept that he seems to have taken the view that all the tests in Malta by Saybolt should have been within the repeatability range, even though the tests on Sample B and C taken in November 2000 and the new composite made up in April 2001 were tests on different samples. He does not explain why this was so, but it may be because he considered that the samples should all have been the same or treated as the same. Accepting this evidence, it points, as he stated in his report, to an inconsistency in the results.\n   Is this sufficient? I do not consider that it is.\n   In the first place, I consider that the relevant sample was sample A. The contract provided for a guaranteed specification at the discharge port; the guarantee plainly applied to the cargo sold to the Buyers and due for discharge and not to the whole of the cargo on the vessel. Similarly the task of Saybolt at Malta was to re-test the parcel to be discharged by means of a composite sample from the ship\xc2\x92s tanks. Their certificate would be a certificate in respect of the composite sample of that cargo and not the other cargo on the vessel. Thus the relevant certification was the certification in respect of the composite sample of that cargo. The relevant sample was sample A;  this was re-checked in April 2001 and the result was within the margin of \xc2\xb13\xc2\xb0C applicable for repeatability. In so far as it might be appropriate to consider the new composite sample prepared in April 2001, as this was a new sample, then the reproducibility range applied and there was no error when that result is compared with the result in the certificate of 22 November 2000.\n   Furthermore even assuming that it is appropriate to apply the repeatability range to the new composite sample prepared in April 2001 (so that the result is outside the range) and/or that it is appropriate to rely upon the test results of samples B and C and apply to them the repeatability range (so that the results are outside the range), then these results would point to an inconsistency, but nothing more. I do not consider that they give rise to any real prospect of showing that there was a plain and obvious error in the certificate or the testing or sampling. On the evidence, there is nothing to show that a plain and obvious error occurred in these tasks; at the highest it shows that if the sampling was done differently, there might have been a different result.  This   might   have been caused by some form of error, but even an error (and not merely the possibility of an error) is not enough. There is no evidence of plain and obvious error. \n   There is one further point, though it only reinforces the conclusion I have reached.  There was no contemporaneous protest by the Buyers about the certificate of 22 November 2000. If the differing results as shown on that certificate (which included the notation that sample C had shown a result of 9\xc2\xb0C and had been re-tested three times) and/or as compared to the result in Tarragona had given rise to a plain and obvious error, then I have no doubt that the Buyers would have raised the point. They said nothing at the time; the new evidence in relation to the tests in April 2001 did not in reality change the position. It is difficult to see how it can be said there was a plain and obvious error when nothing was expressed about it at the time the certificate was produced and part of the cargo accepted.\n   The claim for storage costs: $14,000 A claim was made by the Sellers for storage costs of the cargo they took back under the agreement referred to at paragraph 9.  The only point taken by the Buyers in defence to this claim was that the Court did not have jurisdiction.  I have set out the jurisdiction clause at paragraph 3 above.\n   It was contended by the Buyers that the claim for storage charges was not within that clause and so this court did not have jurisdiction.  The clause provided that this Court was to have jurisdiction to settle any dispute \xc2\x93which might arise out of or in connection with the contract\xc2\x94. These are wide words. It is clear that the dispute in relation to storage charges for the cargo is plainly a matter that arose out of or in connection with the contract.\n   Overall conclusion I therefore have come to the conclusion that the Sellers are entitled to judgment for the amount due in respect of the cargo and the storage charges.\n   '
