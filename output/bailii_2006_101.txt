b'Mr Justice David Steel :   Introduction This action arises out of a collision between the vessels ELEFTHERIA and HAKKI DEVAL which occurred in restricted visibility on 6 June 2004 in the Mediterranean Sea about 15 miles off the Algerian Coast.\r\n   ELEFTHERIA is a bulk carrier registered at Panama.  She was of 38,328 tonnes gross and 20,638 tonnes net, 209 metres in length and 32.2 metres in beam and powered by engines of 13,050 hp.  At the material time she was laden with 41,265 tonnes of soya beans giving her a draft of 10.7 metres fore and aft.  \r\n   HAKKI DEVAL is a bulk carrier registered in Istanbul. She was of 9,669 tonnes gross, some 136 metres in length and 21.2 metres in beam and powered by engines of 55,188 kw.  At the material time she was laden with 15,350 tonnes of steel billets giving a mean draft of 8.86 metres.\r\n   ELEFTHERIA\'s pleaded case in summary was as follows.  She had been steering a course of 082\xc2\xb0 true and, with her engines working at 110 rpm, was making about 13 knots through the water.  The echo of HAKKI DEVAL was first observed at a range of about 8 miles, bearing approximately 5-10\xc2\xb0 on her starboard bow.  Shortly thereafter ELEFTHERIA altered course to 070\xc2\xb0 true with a view to increasing the passing distance between the vessels.  Attempts to contact HAKKI DEVAL by VHF were unsuccessful.  Shortly before collision, HAKKI DEVAL was seen to be turning to starboard towards ELEFTHERIA whereupon ELEFTHERIA\'s engines were reduced to 90 rpm and her wheel put to port.\r\n   HAKKI DEVAL\'s pleaded case in summary was as follows.  She had been steering a course of 252\xc2\xb0 true and was making about 8 knots through the water.  The echo of ELEFTHERIA was first observed at a distance of just over 8 miles, bearing 2\xc2\xb0 on the port bow.  Shortly thereafter the course of HAKKI DEVAL was altered to 266\xc2\xb0.  Contact was then made by VHF with ELEFTHERIA and oral agreement was reached to pass port to port.  Thereafter HAKKI DEVAL altered course by a further 15\xc2\xb0 to starboard.  This in turn was followed by her course being altered by "10\xc2\xb0 to starboard".  And thereafter her engines were stopped and put full astern.\r\n   Neither vessel saw the other until moments before impact.  There were accordingly some substantial issues of fact on the pleaded cases: in particular whether contact by VHF was made between the vessels and, if so, whether an agreement was reached to pass starboard to starboard.\r\n   In addition, as appears from the list of issues prepared by the parties, there were disputes as to the angle of blow, the collision position, the degree of visibility and the sounding of fog signals.\r\n   The witnesses The Claimants in due course served witness statements.  Those of their Master and Chief Officer (the officer of the watch at the material time) were dated prior to the filing of the Claimant\'s collision statement of case.  In contrast, the statements furnished by the Defendants from their Master and 2 nd  Officer (the officer of the watch) were dated after the relevant filing date.  \r\n   The statement of the 2 nd  Officer of HAKKI DEVAL asserted that ELEFTHERIA\'s initial alteration of course to port had been observed (albeit it appeared to be from 080\xc2\xb0 to 073\xc2\xb0) at a range of about 6.8 miles and further that, following agreement to pass starboard to starboard and the second alteration of 15\xc2\xb0 to starboard by HAKKI DEVAL, ELEFTHERIA was seen to alter course to port.  Thereafter HAKKI DEVAL put her "helm" 10\xc2\xb0 to starboard.  When the vessels had closed to about a mile, and following a further exchange on VHF in which ELEFTHERIA stated it was altering course to starboard, she was seen in fact to alter course to port.  It followed that on the basis of this statement there was a further significant issue as to whether ELEFTHERIA altered to port from 073\xc2\xb0 true on two occasions prior to the final hard to port order.  \r\n   To assist the court in the resolution of these issues, various witnesses of fact were called.  The Claimants called a Mr Dindo Dorupan, an able seaman, who was the helmsman of ELEFTHERIA at the time of the collision.  The Defendants called both their Master, Mr Yilmaz Altan and (after a considerable break to enable him to come ashore from another vessel) their 2 nd  Officer, Mr Yucal Yilmaz.\r\n   The action had come for trial with commendable promptness.  Even then it took place some two years after the event.  In considering the oral evidence I have very much in mind the observations of Robert Goff LJ in the  Ocean Frost   [1985] 1 Lloyd\'s Reps 1 at  p.57: -\r\n   "It is frequently very difficult to tell whether a witness is telling the truth or not and where there is a conflict of evidence\xc2\x85. Reference to the objective facts and documents, to the witnesses\' motives, and to the overall probabilities can be of great assistance to a judge in ascertaining the facts." Expert evidence Before turning to the issues of fact, I must touch on the question of expert evidence.  Each party was given leave to instruct a surveyor on the question of speed and angle of blow at collision.  There was a very substantial measure of agreement which made it unnecessary for either of them to be called.\r\n   As regards the question of the angle of blow, the parties accepted that the stem of HAKKI DEVAL struck the starboard side of ELEFTHERIA in way of her No.1 hold at an angle of about 80\xc2\xb0 leading forward.\r\n   As regards the question of speed, the experts approach was sensibly to assess the ratio between the speeds of the two vessels speed.  This was accepted to be in the region of 1.7 i.e. that ELEFTHERIA was steaming at a speed 70% faster than HAKKI DEVAL.  Since it was not suggested that any significant reduction of speed was made by either vessel before collision, this was consistent with the pleaded speeds of 13 knots and 8 knots respectively.\r\n   But the parties were also given leave to call expert evidence on "seamanship and breaches of the collision regulations".  Since a substantial amount of such material was contained within the trial bundles and I held that it was all inadmissible, I should accordingly record the background.\r\n   I have had the benefit of the assistance of two Elder Brethren of Trinity House as assessors.  This conventional arrangement was consistent with the Court\'s order of 8 April 2005 following on the Case Management Conference.  The implications of such an order are well established: -\r\n   "It has been established by decisions of the courts, by textbook writers and by the practice of the Admiralty Court over a very long period that when the Court is assisted by nautical assessors, expert evidence on matters of navigation and seamanship may not be adduced": see e.g.  The Victory  [1996] 2 Lloyd\'s Rep 482 at 492.. This rule is subject to variation and exception in appropriate cases e.g. where the facts involve ship types or remote geographical areas which are unlikely to be familiar to the Elder Brethren or where the specific areas of expertise are outside the general competence of such assessors e.g. the fields of computer reconstruction or modelling.  However, the present case does not fall into any exceptional category and, accordingly, given the objection made on behalf of the Claimant to the admissibility of such evidence, it was necessary to have regard to the circumstances in which the order giving leave was made.\r\n   I have seen the skeleton arguments that were provided to the court for the CMC.  The Claimant sought leave to call an expert on the issues of the angle of blow and speed and, by reference to a draft order, sought the appointment of the assessors.  The Defendant\'s skeleton rightly anticipated a lack of controversy as to the form of order in a case with "no unusual features".  But their draft order nonetheless sought leave to call experts on "seamanship" without the appointment of assessors.  The judge used the Defendant\'s form of order as a template.  The judge accepted that it was appropriate to give leave to call such expert evidence but nonetheless also added the requirement for assessors.  No-one appears to have drawn the judge\'s attention to the significant diversion from the usual practise that this order involved in a case which the parties regarded as straightforward.  \r\n   Both parties thereafter expended substantial effort and expense on expert\'s reports in this field and I was thus presented with a considerable difficulty when at the opening of the trial the Claimant\'s challenged the admissibility of it all.\r\n   A similar situation arose in the  Victory  supra where Mr Geoffrey Brice QC, sitting as a deputy judge of this court, was persuaded to admit the expert evidence which was largely made up of reconstructions and comments on them.\r\n   In the present case, I took a different view.  Despite the apparent agreement of the Claimant at and following the CMC, it does not seem to me that the court is bound to admit the evidence and indeed should not do so unless there are good grounds for doing so.  Of course, the parties can deploy reconstructions prepared by experts as their own for illustrative purposes.  It may also be that other comments made by retained experts can be used in argument.  But the reports could not properly be admitted in evidence and I so ruled.  \r\n   AIS One of the features of the case was that each vessel had recently been fitted with an "Automatic Identification System".  The system is mandatory for cargo vessels under SOLAS Chapter V as from December 2004.  While designed and installed primarily for security purposes, it does provide navigational information which may be of value to watch officers.\r\n   The device, either installed in a radar or as a stand alone item, will reveal amongst many things the name of the relevant target vessel, together with its destination and cargo.  Also available are its geographical position, its heading and its speed.  On the premise that this information is reliable, the equipment will usually furnish a CPA of a selected vessel.\r\n   There are dangers associated with the use of this equipment.  First there may be a temptation for its use in preference to or even in isolation from other navigational aids.  In fact, the primary instruments for safe navigation must remain an alert and systematic visual and radar lookout.  Information derived from AIS may be erroneous: see MGN 277.  \r\n   Second it must also be recognised that it enables attempts to establish radio contact to be undertaken with greater confidence.  However, regardless whether contact is made, navigators must continue to observe the collision regulations: see  Maloja II  [1993] 1 Lloyd\'s Reps 48.  As will emerge, on the facts of the present case, it is not necessary to develop these points further.\r\n   ELEFTHERIA\'s course and speed It is common ground that ELEFTHERIA had been proceeding on a course of 082\xc2\xb0 at 13 knots.  It is also accepted that the echo of HAKKI DEVAL was observed at about 8 miles (say C-23).  Further it is also not contentious that shortly thereafter (say C-22) ELEFTHERIA altered 12\xc2\xb0 to port onto 070\xc2\xb0 and that she put her helm 15\xc2\xb0 to port shortly before collision, coming round to a heading of 030\xc2\xb0 by impact.\r\n   The primary issue is whether ELEFTHERIA altered to port between these two events.  In my judgment the answer must be "no":\r\n   a)\tThose on HAKKI DEVAL claim to have seen ELEFTHERIA\'s alteration to about 070\xc2\xb0/073\xc2\xb0 from information derived from ELEFTHERIA\'s AIS.  Her pleaded case is that, when seen at very close range (100 metres), ELEFTHERIA was still on that course.  Such is an admission on the part of HAKKI DEVAL amendment of which would only be granted in exceptional circumstances: see Admiralty and Commercial Court Guide N.5.7.  In any event, no application to amend that pleading was ever made. b)\tIn this connection it is notable that the Defendant\'s witness statements in which reference is made by the 2 nd  Officer to alterations to port by ELEFTHERIA beyond 073\xc2\xb0 were dated July 2005 whilst the Collision Statement of case had been filed in December 2004. c)\tThe written and oral evidence of Mr Dorupan was to the effect that no wheel order (let alone new course) was given by the officer of the watch between the alteration to 070\xc2\xb0 and final order of 15\xc2\xb0 port helm.  I was not able to discern any reason for not accepting that evidence.  Certainly his evidence of the heading at collision of 030\xc2\xb0 was not even challenged.   d)\tThere is, it is fair to say, a reference to an alteration of course by ELEFTHERIA in the 2 nd  Officer\'s notebook.  She is described as coming "a little to port" after HAKKI DEVAL had altered 15\xc2\xb0 onto 266\xc2\xb0.  The extent to which this note was contemporary is controversial but in any event it is inconsistent with the suggestion made in the later statement that ELEFTHERIA was to be seen altering to port after a second alteration of 15\xc2\xb0 by HAKKI DEVAL thereby furnishing the catalyst for putting her helm 10\xc2\xb0 to starboard. e)\tI discuss hereafter the contention by HAKKI DEVAL that there was an oral agreement made by VHF to pass port to port.  For the moment it is sufficient to say that, if such was agreed, it makes it very difficult to comprehend why ELEFTHERIA would nonetheless alter to port.  If such was not agreed, it obviously throws grave doubt on the credibility of the Defendant\'s case. It follows that I conclude that ELEFTHERIA was on a course of 082\xc2\xb0 until C-22.  She then altered to 070\xc2\xb0.  Her next and final alteration was by reason the helm being put 15\xc2\xb0 to port through to collision on a heading of 030\xc2\xb0.  Throughout she was proceeding at 13knots.  I asked the Elder Brethren the following question:\r\n   "Having regard to the manoeuvring characteristics of ELEFTHERIA, what is the maximum time needed for her to alter 40\xc2\xb0 to port under 15\xc2\xb0 of port helm at 13 knots?"     Their answer was: "No more than 2\xc2\xbd minutes and probably nearer 2 minutes". I accept that advice.  Accordingly her track could be readily plotted back from a notional collision position.\r\n   HAKKI DEVAL\'s course and speed The question of speed is easy: it is common ground that throughout she was proceeding at 8 knots.  \r\n   Her initial course had been 252\xc2\xb0 as from her plotted 0330 way point.  It is also common ground, as I understand it, that she put her helm 10\xc2\xb0 to starboard for a period through to very shortly before collision.  The primary issue between the parties is whether she had previously altered 15\xc2\xb0 to starboard on one or even two occasions.\r\n   The initial alteration of 15\xc2\xb0 was said to have occurred after the VHF agreement to pass port to port.  It appeared to be accepted that such an alteration was made albeit, on the Claimant\'s case, not against background of an agreement.  Despite that common ground, it is to be noted that such an alteration on the Defendants\' case occurred shortly after the initial alteration of course to port by ELEFTHERIA was discerned.  If these were the circumstances, it might be regarded as a strange response since it merely ensured that the CPA remained similar to that before the earlier alteration. \r\n   It is accordingly necessary to turn to the question of VHF exchanges.  Both ships sought to contact the other.  Only HAKKI DEVAL asserts that she was successful.  The assertion emerged for the first time in a notebook maintained by the 2 nd  Officer of HAKKI DEVAL.  The reliability of this document is to a significant extent dependent on how contemporary the document was.\r\n   The relevant entry was as follows:-\r\n   "0344 distance 6.8 miles called again channel 16 ELEFTHERIA answered channel 69 old and tired voice.  "We are altering course to starboard; we will pass port to port.  Ok?"  He said "I agree with you."  Channel 16 again. "We altered course to starboard by autopilot"." It was the 2 nd  Officer\'s evidence in his statement that the entries in the notebook were made "as soon as possible after those events had occurred".  In his oral evidence, which was somewhat confused on this topic, he claimed as follows:\r\n   a)\tThat he had some scrap paper on which he recorded events as they occurred. b)\tThese entries were then transferred almost immediately into the notebook. c)\tThis process was duly accomplished in regard to all entries in his notebook right up to the moment of collision: the first entry after collision was "0407 collision: General Alarm".   I regret that I am unable to accept that account: \r\n   a)\tThere was no particular need to note ELEFTHERIA\'s echo on his first observation.  The first entry reads as follows: - "0340 I obtained one target 8.1 miles port/bow 2\xc2\xb0.  Radar was on trail mode 1 minute.  Checked by AIS, vessel\'s name was ELEFTHERIA heading was 080\xc2\xb0 course over the ground was 077 speed 11.8 knots".  [Then he sets out the position of ELEFTHERIA and of HAKKI DEVAL].  Speed was 8 knots, CPA was .3/.1 nautical miles.  I checked my binoculars portside but could not see her." It is striking that no record of a sighting whether visually or by radar of any other vessel (let alone a detailed entry together with the relevant navigational response) appears in the entire notebook which covers a substantial number of voyages.   b)\tSuch an entry (which initially the witness was minded to suggest had been written in after the collision in what on that basis would have been a convenient gap) would require a considerable period of time to make, thus interfering with the task of conning the vessel and keeping good look-out: the more-so if recorded on scrap paper and then transferred to the notebook. c)\tThe form and content of the note is wholly inconsistent with it being contemporaneous.  Other examples are as follows: "0330 Called ELEFTHERIA.  I used starboard VHF channel 16 \xc2\x96 no response. 0344 (see above) 0345 Courses 266\xc2\xb0  0346 Checked radar other ship altered course a little to port. He must alter course to starboard.  Again the other vessel has been called, no response.  On channel 16 I said alter your course to starboard.  No response.  I altered my course a little bit more to starboard.  I checked my binoculars I could not see the ship. 0355 Call to engine room, visibility reduced a little, I said to engine room to give air for whistle and wait on standby. 0356 Helm on manual: Sadet starboard 10\xc2\xb0 he made that.  Whistle is working.  We have one short blast and then after on automatic whistle for poor visibility." There can be no doubt, in my judgment, that this is an account prepared after the collision and then copied largely word for word into the fair deck log.  The only question is when? It would seem clear that it formed the basis of the Defendants\' case as pleaded and I would accordingly find that it was made some time after the collision as part of a record or report to the master or owners.  It is certainly not a contemporary record of the alleged VHF agreement.\r\n   Did the alleged agreement occur? In my judgement again the answer must be "no".  My rejection of the alleged contemporaneity of the report undermines the credibility of the 2 nd  Officer.  In any event:\r\n   a)\tThe vessels were at all material times within 8 miles of each other and closing, thus well within the range for VHF traffic. b)\tInformation from AIS enabled both vessels to direct their messages by name. c)\tWhilst HAKKI DEVAL alleges making contact on two occasions, her account suggests that there were numerous other calls that went unanswered for some unexplained reason. d)\tThe initial exchange allegedly concluded with ELEFTHERIA saying:  "We are altering course to starboard". Yet no such alteration was made.  e)\tThe second exchange ended in a similar fashion.  It is difficult to discern why ELEFTHERIA would disregard the agreement, let alone mislead HAKKI DEVAL. I now return to the question of the timing of HAKKI DEVAL\'s initial alteration to starboard.  The 2 nd  Officer\'s account in his notebook is set out above.  At first blush, there would appear to be some considerable difficulties with this account:\r\n   a)\tOnce it is accepted that there was no VHF exchange, the credibility of the entire account is further undermined including both the timing of and the motive for the alteration to starboard. b)\tIn fact it is not clear that the account asserts any perceived alteration of course to port by ELEFTHERIA.  The heading of ELEFTHERIA is initially recorded as 080\xc2\xb0, but with a course made good of 077\xc2\xb0.  The next entry records her course over the ground as "checked" being 073\xc2\xb0.  There is thus a considerable disparity from ELEFTHERIA\'s actual headings of 082\xc2\xb0 and 070\xc2\xb0.  On one view, the course of ELEFTHERIA was simply observed as broadly in the range of 077/073\xc2\xb0 i.e after the alteration to port had taken place.  c)\tThe initial bearing of 2\xc2\xb0 on the port bow is very precise.  If accurate it is only consistent with an alteration to starboard by HAKKI DEVAL at a very much later stage: certainly not at C-20. However, despite these uncertainties, the fact of this turn occurring at about C-20 did not appear to be contentious.  According to the 2 nd  Officer of HAKKI DEVAL, the time to collision from the initial sighting at 8.1 miles was some 27 minutes.  But included in that period is some 4 minutes of full astern.  This, cannot be right.  The vessel was still proceeding at 8 knots or thereabouts at collision.  It follows that the order for full astern was probably about three minutes later at C- 1.  This is consistent with sighting at a range 8 to 9 miles (e.g.C-24) and an alteration to 266\xc2\xb0 about 5 minutes later (C-19).  Accordingly I accept that such an alteration was made at that time.\r\n   Before leaving the issue of the two vessels\' course and speed, I must touch on a proposition advanced by the Claimants in written additional submissions furnished after the hearing to the effect that it was appropriate to plot HAKKI DEVAL\'s track by reference to her working chart so as to determine the extent to which she came to starboard.\r\n   In my judgment, this admixture of plotting back from the collision in respect of one of the vessels (ELEFTHERIA) and forward to collision in respect of the other is not helpful \xc2\x96 not least because of the margins of error in the collision position pleaded by HAKKI DEVAL.  Accordingly, the invitation to find that HAKKI DEVAL altered 45\xc2\xb0 to starboard in some general sort of way over the 20 minute period before collision as depicted in the Claimants\' reconstruction is rejected.\r\n   So far as the final alteration under 10\xc2\xb0 of starboard helm is concerned by HAKKI DEVAL, it is clear that the collision occurred immediately after the final hard to starboard /full astern order which achieved no material loss of speed.  In short I find that the period required to put her helm over and to commence stopping and thereafter reversing the engines was overtaken by impact.\r\n   I have already found that ELEFTHERIA\'s heading at collision was 030 and that the angle of blow was 80\xc2\xb0 leaning forward on ELEFTHERIA.  Thus the heading of HAKKI DEVAL at collision was 310\xc2\xb0.  This would involve an alteration to starboard by HAKKI DEVAL of 44\xc2\xb0 from 266\xc2\xb0.\r\n   I have asked the Elder Brethren the following question:\r\n   "Having regard to the manoeuvring data of HAKKI DEVAL, what is the maximum period of time required for HAKKI DEVAL to alter 44\xc2\xb0 to starboard under 10\xc2\xb0 of helm at 8 knots?" Their answer was:\r\n   "A maximum of 4 minutes but probably only 3-3\xc2\xbd minutes." I accept that advice. Plot of approach From these various findings on the course and speed of each vessel, it is possible to make with the help of my assessors a broad reconstruction of the vessels\' approach, working back from the vessels\' headings at collision.  Such a reconstruction does not require any allowance for current in determining their relative approach.\r\n   The picture that emerges is as follows: \r\n   a)\tAt C-23 the vessels were 8 miles apart.  HAKKI DEVAL was bearing about 6\xc2\xb0 on the port bow of ELEFTHERIA and ELEFTHERIA was bearing about 5\xc2\xb0 on the starboard bow of HAKKI DEVAL with a CPA of about 0.3 cables. b)\t At C-22, following ELEFTHERIA\'s alteration to 070\xc2\xb0, the range was 7\xc2\xbd miles.  HAKKI DEVAL was now 5\xc2\xb0 on the starboard bow of ELEFTHERIA with a CPA of 6\xc2\xbd cables. c)\tAt C-20, following HAKKI DEVAL\'s alteration of course to starboard to 266\xc2\xb0 ELEFTHERIA was 10\xc2\xb0 on the port bow of HAKKI DEVAL.  The CPA was now zero. d)\tAt C-4, the range was just over 1 mile with HAKKI DEVAL about 6\xc2\xb0 on ELEFTHERIA\'s starboard bow and ELEFTHERIA about 10\xc2\xb0 on HAKKI DEVAL\'s port bow. Relevant Collision Regulations Before turning to the faults of each vessel I must consider the application of the collision regulations to the material circumstances.\r\n   First, it is common ground that the vessels were navigating in restricted visibility within the meaning of Rule 19.  It is possible that HAKKI DEVAL had had more extensive visibility, certainly earlier in her passage, than that available to ELEFTHERIA.  However, by the time each identified the echo of the other, visibility had been closing in and I find from that moment onwards the visibility was substantially less than 4 miles and reducing to a matter of a few 100 metres by the time of impact.  In any event, any disparity of visibility must be considered against the background that, by amendment, the regulations relating to conduct of vessels in restricted visibility applied to vessels "in or  near " an area of restricted visibility.\r\n   Secondly, the question arises whether at the time the vessels detected each other to a range of about 8 miles "a close quarter\'s situation" was developing within the meaning of Rule 19.  I asked the Elder Brethren the following question:\r\n   "Assuming that visibility was less than 4 miles, that each vessel had detected the echo of the other at a range of about 8 miles and that the CPA was in the region of 3 cables port to port, was a close quarter\'s situation developing?"   Their answer was, and I accept it, as follows: "The short answer is yes.  Indeed the situation had developed shortly thereafter to the extent that risk of collision existed." Faults of ELEFTHERIA The faults in the navigation were to some extent accepted by the Claimants.  They can be summarised as follows:\r\n   i)\t Poor lookout ; The initial sighting of HAKKI DEVAL was entirely erroneous.  Far from being some 5-10 \xc2\xb0 on ELEFTHERIA\'s starboard bow, HAKKI DEVAL was fine on ELEFTHERIA\'s port bow.  HAKKI DEVAL was not passing clear to starboard at about 1 mile but at a range of about 3 cables port to port. After that time (and indeed following the alteration of course 070\xc2\xb0) no adequate attempt was made to monitor the progress of HAKKI DEVAL by systematic radar observations.  If such had occurred it would have been apparent that the vessels were steering into danger, the more so as a result of HAKKI DEVALs alteration to starboard. ii)\tSpeed   The obligation on ELEFTHERIA was to proceed at a speed which is safe in all the circumstances.  It is conceded that 13 knots was excessive.  I have taken the advice of the Elder Brethren on this issue and have asked them the following question: - "Assuming the visibility was 4 miles or less, was the speed of the ELEFTHERIA excessive having regard to her navigational aids?" Their answer was: "Yes: in a well used traffic lane off the Northern Coast of Africa in reduced visibility, she should have reduced to manoeuvring speed (approx. 10 knots). Certainly such a speed should have been achieved by C-15 when the vessels were 5 miles apart and on a collision course." I accept that advice. iii)\t Port Helm The alteration to 070\xc2\xb0 true was made at a range of about 7\xc2\xbd miles with a consequential CPA of about 6\xc2\xbd cables to starboard.  I have asked the Elder Brethren the following question: - "Given the close quarters situation developing at a range of 8 miles, was the alteration by ELEFTHERIA of 12\xc2\xb0 to port in accordance with good seamanship?" Their answer was: "No.  In restricted visibility, an alteration to port at that stage was inadvisable.  Indeed it was based on a wrong appreciation that the vessels were shaping to pass starboard to starboard.  In any event it failed to alter the fact that a close quarters situation was developing.  The circumstances required a bold alteration of course to starboard of no less than 30\xc2\xb0." iv )\tEngine action In the absence of a bold alteration and the continued advance of HAKKI DEVAL with risk of collision, in my judgment vigorous steps to take off way should have been undertaken not later than C-6 when the vessels were 2 miles apart.  I have asked the Elder Brethren whether they agree with this assessment and they do. Faults of HAKKI DEVAL i)\t Speed It is not suggested that HAKKI DEVAL\'s speed was unsafe. ii)\tLookout Just as with ELEFTHERIA the lookout on HAKKI DEVAL was dismal.  The initial sighting of the echo of ELEFTHERIA to the effect that she was fine on the port bow of HAKKI DEVAL was wrong.  She was somewhat broader on the starboard bow.  More to the point, as with ELEFTHERIA, it is clear that thereafter no effective monitoring of the approach of ELEFTHERIA was undertaken save the observation of her initial alteration to port. iii)\t Starboard helm This latter observation which I have accepted makes the subsequent alteration of 15\xc2\xb0 to starboard all the more remarkable.  I have asked the Elder Brethren this question: - "Was HAKKI DEVAL\'s subsequent alteration of 15\xc2\xb0 to starboard, having detected the porting by ELEFTHERIA, in accord with good seamanship?" \t\t    Their answer which I accept was: "No: the effect of the course alteration by ELEFTHERIA should have been carefully monitored (and the master called to the bridge). Any subsequent alteration by HAKKI DEVAL should have been of no less than 30\xc2\xb0." iv)\t Engine action Although proceeding at a safe speed, it was unsafe to stand-on applying 10\xc2\xb0 of starboard helm as from C-3 at a range of about 1 mile.  The proper action, in my judgment, would have been vigorous steps to take off way at C-5 or C- 6 (or to take a round turn).  I have asked the Elder Brethren whether they agree and they do. Various other allegations were made by each side on such issues as regards fog signals, VHF calls and so on.  I do not find it necessary to embark on these as they were not causative.\r\n   Apportionment I have no doubt that ELEFTHERIA must bear the preponderance of blame primarily because of her excessive speed but also because of her ill advised (albeit perceived) alteration to port.  However, the lookout on both vessels was appalling and no sensible or let alone robust steps were taken to avoid collision by either vessel.  \r\n   In my judgment a fair apportionment would be 1/3 rd   2/3 rd  in favour of HAKKI DEVAL.\r\n   '
