b'Mr Justice Cooke:   In these two actions, the\xc2\xa0swap action and the\xc2\xa0lenders\' action, the\xc2\xa0defendants, UGL and Unitech, seek permission to amend their statements of case, the\xc2\xa0defence and counterclaim in each action.  The\xc2\xa0claimants in each action resist on the basis that the\xc2\xa0case raised by the\xc2\xa0proposed amendments has no realistic prospect of success.\r\n   The\xc2\xa0proposed amendments arise at this stage because of the\xc2\xa0publicity given to allegations of manipulation of LIBOR by a\xc2\xa0number of banks, including the\xc2\xa0first claimant, DB\xc2\xa0AG.  Material obtained from investigations into this alleged manipulation and press cuttings have been garnered by the defendants which suggest that DB\xc2\xa0AG was involved in the\xc2\xa0manipulation of the\xc2\xa0yen LIBOR rate and possibly other LIBOR rates at some stage in the\xc2\xa0period between 2005 and 2011.  The\xc2\xa0allegations are denied and there are factual issues raised which cannot be determined by the court at an\xc2\xa0interlocutory stage, as all the\xc2\xa0parties recognise.  The\xc2\xa0claimants say, however, that the case, as prospectively pleaded, cannot succeed regardless of any issues of fact which arise in relation to the\xc2\xa0manipulation of such rates.\r\n   In the\xc2\xa0lenders\' action, the\xc2\xa0claimants claim against UGL under a\xc2\xa0credit facility agreement of 24\xc2\xa0September\xc2\xa02007 as amended by a\xc2\xa0term sheet dated 22\xc2\xa0October\xc2\xa02010 and against Unitech as UGL\'s parent company guarantor.  $150\xc2\xa0million was advanced and, as a\xc2\xa0result of various alleged failures to pay instalments due, or other events of default, repayment was accelerated so that the\xc2\xa0total is allegedly due to the\xc2\xa0lenders.  The\xc2\xa0second to ninth claimants are said to have acceded to the\xc2\xa0credit facility agreement by virtue of an\xc2\xa0assignment or transfer of rights or novation pursuant to clause\xc2\xa029 of that agreement.\r\n   DB\xc2\xa0AG claims $11\xc2\xa0million, approximately, from Unitech under the\xc2\xa0same guarantee of UGL\'s obligations in respect of an\xc2\xa0interest rate swap agreement, which incorporated the\xc2\xa0terms of the\xc2\xa0ISDA master agreement and the\xc2\xa02000 terms.  The\xc2\xa0defendants\' case is that this swap agreement was proposed by DB AG as a hedge for UGL against interest rate fluctuations and that the credit facility agreement and the\xc2\xa0swap agreement were part of a\xc2\xa0package deal.  Unitech and UGL contend that the swap agreement was represented and recommended as suitable for UGL when it was not, particularly by reference to the\xc2\xa0terms of the\xc2\xa0credit facility agreement itself.  It is alleged that the misrepresentations induced the\xc2\xa0two agreements and were made in breach of a\xc2\xa0duty of care owed by DB\xc2\xa0AG.\r\n   The\xc2\xa0credit facility agreement provided for payment of interest by reference to LIBOR, which was defined in the\xc2\xa0definitions section by reference to the\xc2\xa0applicable screen rate as displayed for the\xc2\xa0relevant currency and term, or overdue amount, on the appropriate page of the\xc2\xa0Reuters or Telerate screens.  \r\n   Under the\xc2\xa0interest rate swap confirmation, the\xc2\xa0obligations under the\xc2\xa0floating rate payment provisions were determined by reference to the\xc2\xa0six month US dollar LIBOR rate, as set out in the\xc2\xa0annex to ISDA 2000:\r\n   "The\xc2\xa0rate for a\xc2\xa0reset date will be the\xc2\xa0rate for deposits in US dollars for a\xc2\xa0period of the\xc2\xa0designated maturity, which appears on the Telerate, page\xc2\xa03750, as of 11.00 am London time on the day that is two London banking days preceding that recent date.  If such rate does not appear on the Telerate page\xc2\xa03750 the\xc2\xa0rate for that reset date will be determined as if the parties had specified US dollar LIBOR reference banks as the\xc2\xa0applicable floating rate option."  The\xc2\xa0evidence produced to the\xc2\xa0court by DB\xc2\xa0AG includes the\xc2\xa0following in a\xc2\xa0statement of Ms\xc2\xa0Eastwood, paragraph\xc2\xa06:\r\n   "The\xc2\xa0Defendant\'s proposed amendments rely upon the allegation that DB was itself involved in the\xc2\xa0manipulation of LIBOR and knew that other panel banks were also involved in LIBOR manipulation.  \xc2\x85 9.  LIBOR refers to a\xc2\xa0series of benchmark reference rates published each trading day by Thomson Reuters on behalf of the British\xc2\xa0Bankers\'\xc2\xa0Association.  Other, similar but distinct, benchmarks exist and are administered by other banking organisations, such as Euribor and Tibor.   10.  There are currently LIBOR reference rates for ten different currencies.  For each currency there is a\xc2\xa0rate for each of 15 different maturity periods (or \'tenors\') ranging from overnight to one year.  There are, therefore, 150 different LIBOR rates in total.  11.  The\xc2\xa0only LIBOR rate specifically referenced in and relevant to the\xc2\xa0swap is the\xc2\xa0six month USD LIBOR rate. 12.  The\xc2\xa0LIBOR rate is used across the\xc2\xa0world in relation to a\xc2\xa0wide range of financial products.  There is no comprehensive data available on the extent of LIBOR\'s use but the\xc2\xa0Wheatley Review of LIBOR published in\xc2\xa0September\xc2\xa02012 considered a\xc2\xa0number of sources and estimated that contracts with a\xc2\xa0notional value in excess of $300\xc2\xa0trillion use the\xc2\xa0LIBOR rate (including $10\xc2\xa0trillion of syndicated loans and $165 to $230\xc2\xa0trillion of interest rate swaps).  The\xc2\xa0Wheatley Review also recognised that some estimates put the true figure as high as $800\xc2\xa0trillion.   13.  Prior to\xc2\xa0February\xc2\xa02011, the\xc2\xa0USD LIBOR panel consisted of 16 contributor banks and the\xc2\xa0USD LIBOR rates were calculated in the\xc2\xa0following manner:  (1)  Each contributor bank would submit its USD LIBOR submissions to Thomson Reuters based on the following question: \'at what rate could you borrow funds, were you to do so by asking for and then accepting inter-bank offers in a\xc2\xa0reasonable market size just prior to 11 am? (2)  Upon receiving submissions from the\xc2\xa0contributor banks, Thomson Reuters would exclude the four highest and the four lowest rates.  The\xc2\xa0remaining (eight) rates were, arithmetically averaged to produce the\xc2\xa0USD LIBOR rates.   (3)  Accordingly, higher and low \'outlying\' submissions were excluded from the\xc2\xa0published LIBOR rates. 14.  In 2009, the\xc2\xa0BBA published a\xc2\xa0two page set of guidelines \'intended to provide a\xc2\xa0reference for contributing banks\' ... As the\xc2\xa02009 BBA guidelines state, a\xc2\xa0\'bank\'s LIBOR submissions are its own perception of where it could take funds\' in a reasonable market size.  LIBOR submissions are therefore a\xc2\xa0subjective assessment of inter-bank borrowing by a\xc2\xa0panel bank."  The\xc2\xa0proposed amendments in both actions consist of the\xc2\xa0same essential allegations against DB\xc2\xa0AG with additional allegations in the\xc2\xa0lenders\' action against each of the\xc2\xa0second to ninth claimants, who are said to be successors to DB\xc2\xa0AG\'s rights.  As appears hereafter, there is a\xc2\xa0significant difference between DB\xc2\xa0AG\'s position and the\xc2\xa0other claims inasmuch as Deutsche\xc2\xa0Bank participated in LIBOR panels but none of the\xc2\xa0other claimants did.  \r\n   The\xc2\xa0new common allegations to both actions consist of four misrepresentations which are said to have induced UGL to enter into the\xc2\xa0credit facility agreement and the\xc2\xa0swap agreement.  Now, for convenience they have been labelled as A to D and they were entitled by UGL and Unitech as "The LIBOR Representations".  If UGL and Unitech had been aware of the falsity of these representations, it is said that the transactions would not have been concluded.  Alternatively, it is said that the LIBOR representations were made negligently, in breach of a\xc2\xa0duty of care and dishonestly; and that in making the LIBOR representations, DB AG:\r\n   "... gave an implied warranty that the representations were true." There were, thus, claims under the Misrepresentation Act, claims under Hedley Byrne and claims for breach of contractual warranty.  The new plea of the LIBOR misrepresentations is founded upon two paragraphs in each pleading which refer, first, to the part played by DB AG in the assessment of LIBOR, and then to the reference to LIBOR in the credit facility agreement and swap agreement.  Thus in the lenders\' action the following appears, under the heading "The LIBOR Misrepresentations":\r\n   "5GA.  At all material times the First Claimant [that is DB AG] was a member of the panel of banks (\'the Panel\') which reports rates to Thomson Reuters on behalf of the British Banking Association ... which are used in setting the published London Inter-Bank Offered Rates.  LIBOR is determined by a\xc2\xa0daily poll carried out on behalf of the\xc2\xa0BBA that asks banks on the Panel to estimate how much it would cost them to borrow from each other in a reasonable market size shortly before 11 am London time on that day for different periods and in different currencies. 5GB.  Pursuant to clause\xc2\xa08.1 of the\xc2\xa0Credit Agreement the\xc2\xa0First Defendant\'s liability to pay interest on the Loan was determined by reference to LIBOR.  Further, the\xc2\xa0basis of the\xc2\xa0First Claimant\'s obligations under the\xc2\xa0Swap, being the\xc2\xa0Floating Rate Option as set out in the\xc2\xa0Long Form Confirmation, was determined by reference to USD-LIBOR-BBA." The\xc2\xa0pleas of the\xc2\xa0LIBOR misrepresentations followed the\xc2\xa0words "in the\xc2\xa0premises" which appear at the very beginning of clause 5GC in the\xc2\xa0lenders\' action.  DB\xc2\xa0AG by its conduct and/or impliedly is said to have represented to the\xc2\xa0defendants that: \r\n   "(1)  LIBOR was a\xc2\xa0genuine average of the\xc2\xa0estimated rate at which members of the\xc2\xa0Panel could borrow from each other in a\xc2\xa0reasonable market size just prior to 11\xc2\xa0am London time on any given day, as set out in the\xc2\xa0last sentence of paragraph 5GA above.   (2)  The\xc2\xa0LIBOR rate itself was a rate based on the respective Panel member banks\' submissions to Thomson Reuters which were good faith accurate estimates of the\xc2\xa0rate at which they could actually borrow from each other in a\xc2\xa0reasonable market size just prior to 11 am London time on any given day, as set out in the\xc2\xa0last sentence of paragraph 5GA above.   (3)  The\xc2\xa0First Claimant had not itself acted, was not acting, and had no intention of acting, in a\xc2\xa0way which would, or would be likely to, undermine the integrity of LIBOR.   (4)  The\xc2\xa0first claimant was not aware of any conduct (either its own, or of other banks on the Panel) which would, or would be likely to, undermine the\xc2\xa0integrity of LIBOR." As the\xc2\xa0claimants point out, this plea has a\xc2\xa0number of remarkable features.  It is a\xc2\xa0plea of representation by conduct or implication unattached to any plea of any express representation of any kind.  It is not a\xc2\xa0plea of an\xc2\xa0implied promise not to manipulate the\xc2\xa0LIBOR rate in the\xc2\xa0future, which if broken could result in alteration of the\xc2\xa0interest payable under the\xc2\xa0loan, or the\xc2\xa0operation of the\xc2\xa0interest rate swap payment obligations.  That, it might be thought, would be a\xc2\xa0more logical plea to make than a\xc2\xa0series of implied representations by conduct said to be made by entering into two deals by reference to a\xc2\xa0specific LIBOR rate and as a\xc2\xa0result of being one of a\xc2\xa0number of contributors who reported to Thomson Reuters for the\xc2\xa0setting of a\xc2\xa0number of different LIBOR rates.  The\xc2\xa0damages which might flow from breach of an\xc2\xa0implied promissory term of this kind as opposed to a\xc2\xa0breach of the\xc2\xa0alleged warranty might be hard to establish because of the\xc2\xa0limited role any one contributor might have (although a\xc2\xa0much larger conspiracy might be shown with significant impact) and and because the\xc2\xa0impact on the two particular transactions might be limited in itself.  What UGL and Unitech allege, however, is intended to give rise to more wholesale relief in relation to the\xc2\xa0loan, namely rescission or discharge of liability, though how that could be achieved is fraught with some difficulty, as appears hereafter.\r\n   What is also not alleged is that Unitech\'s obligations under the\xc2\xa0swap were, in fact, affected by any manipulation of LIBOR by DB\xc2\xa0AG or any other entity.  No specific loss is said to be suffered from the misrepresentations, but it is alleged that the deal would not have been consummated if those representations had not been made.  The\xc2\xa0effect of the\xc2\xa0deal being made was, however, the\xc2\xa0receipt by UGL of $150\xc2\xa0million by way of loan, due for repayment in accordance with the\xc2\xa0terms of the\xc2\xa0facility agreement, but which it has not yet repaid.  If the\xc2\xa0transaction were to be set aside or rescinded, then presumably restitution of that sum would be required, whatever other consequences might follow in relation to contractual repayment obligations and questions of payment of interest.\r\n   For a\xc2\xa0representation to be actionable, it must be a\xc2\xa0representation of existing fact or law.  Silence on its own is, as is recognised, not enough.  The\xc2\xa0claimants refer to Lord\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Mance, as he then was, in  Primus Telecommunications v MCI\xc2\xa0WorldCom\xc2\xa0International   [2004] EWCA Civ 957 , where the\xc2\xa0objective nature of the\xc2\xa0test is set out:\r\n   "As I\xc2\xa0presently see the\xc2\xa0position, whether there is a\xc2\xa0representation and what its nature is must be judged objectively, according to the\xc2\xa0impact that whatever is said may be expected to have on a reasonable representee in the position and with the known characteristics of the\xc2\xa0actual representee.  Just as contractual interpretation depends on ascertaining the\xc2\xa0meaning which the\xc2\xa0documents would convey to a\xc2\xa0reasonable person, having all the\xc2\xa0background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the\xc2\xa0parties and the\xc2\xa0situation in which they were at the time of the\xc2\xa0contract." So far as the\xc2\xa0test for implied representations is concerned, the\xc2\xa0claimants rely upon a\xc2\xa0passage in  IFE Fund v Goldman Sachs Inter national [2006] 2 CLC 1056 where Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Toulson, as he then was, said:\r\n   "In determining whether there has been an express representation, and to what effect, the\xc2\xa0court has to consider what reasonable person would have understood from the\xc2\xa0words used in the\xc2\xa0context in which they were used.  In determining what, if any, implied representation has been made, the\xc2\xa0court has to perform a\xc2\xa0similar task, except that it has to consider what a\xc2\xa0reasonable person would have inferred was being implicitly represented by the representor\'s words and conduct in their context." Most implied representations, I\xc2\xa0think it is fair to say, do arise in the\xc2\xa0context of express representations, but none are here alleged.  There are certain well recognised categories of implied representation, such as those which arise where an\xc2\xa0opinion is given and there is an\xc2\xa0implied representation that the opinion given was honestly held.  A\xc2\xa0further example is the\xc2\xa0implication of facts that can sometimes arise where an\xc2\xa0opinion is given, the\xc2\xa0fact being that the representor believes that facts exist which reasonably justify the\xc2\xa0opinion expressed.\r\n   Representations by conduct could, likewise, arise if there were express representations or surrounding circumstances which mean that the conduct on an\xc2\xa0objective basis would be taken as such a\xc2\xa0representation by a\xc2\xa0reasonable person in the\xc2\xa0position of the\xc2\xa0alleged representee.  \r\n   I\xc2\xa0accept the\xc2\xa0submission of DB\xc2\xa0AG that the\xc2\xa0court must consider whether a\xc2\xa0reasonable representee in the\xc2\xa0position of and with the\xc2\xa0known characteristics of Unitech would reasonably have understood that an\xc2\xa0implied statement was being made and being made substantially in the\xc2\xa0terms or to the\xc2\xa0effect alleged, by reason of the\xc2\xa0facts which are relied on by Unitech, to which I\xc2\xa0have already made reference, namely that DB\xc2\xa0AG was a\xc2\xa0LIBOR panel bank and entered into the\xc2\xa0swap which was linked to LIBOR or the\xc2\xa0credit facility agreement as the\xc2\xa0case may be.  Whilst that was the limit of the pleading, the evidence before the court showed draft term sheets exchanged in negotiations, with the same or similar references to LIBOR rates.  Mr Brisby QC relied on that evidence too.  \r\n   I\xc2\xa0am unable to see how, on the basis of the\xc2\xa0two factors relied on by UGL and Unitech, any such representation could be spelt out.  Moreover, as both DB\xc2\xa0AG and the\xc2\xa0other acceding lenders point out, the\xc2\xa0documents comprising the\xc2\xa0transactions militate against such representations, although this factor is of much less weight in a\xc2\xa0situation where dishonesty is alleged.  Mr\xc2\xa0Brisby QC relies on the\xc2\xa0maxim "Fraud unravels all" in this context.\r\n   Nonetheless, the\xc2\xa0position is as follows: (i) The\xc2\xa0draft term sheets and the\xc2\xa0final term sheet for the\xc2\xa0swap contained a\xc2\xa0disclaimer of responsibility for any representations as to information provided in the\xc2\xa0document itself:\r\n   "This term sheet does not constitute an\xc2\xa0offer, an\xc2\xa0invitation to offer or a\xc2\xa0recommendation to enter into any transaction ... DB transacts business with counterparties on an\xc2\xa0arms-length basis and on the basis that each counter party is sophisticated and capable of independently evaluating the merits and risk of each transaction. DB is not acting as your financial adviser or in any other fiduciary capacity with respect to this proposed transaction unless otherwise expressly agreed by us in writing, therefore this document does not constitute advice or a\xc2\xa0recommendation.  This transaction may not be appropriate for all investors and before entering into any transaction you should take steps to ensure that you fully understand the\xc2\xa0transaction and have made an\xc2\xa0independent assessment of the\xc2\xa0appropriateness of the\xc2\xa0transaction in the\xc2\xa0light of your own objectives and circumstances, including the\xc2\xa0possible risks and benefits of entering into such a\xc2\xa0transaction.  You should also consider seeking advice from your own advisers in making this assessment.  If you decide to enter into this transaction, you do so in reliance on your own judgment ... although we believe the\xc2\xa0contents of this document to be reliable, we make no representation as to the completeness or accuracy of the\xc2\xa0information." (ii)  The\xc2\xa0confirmation of the\xc2\xa0swap included an\xc2\xa0entire agreement clause by virtue of the\xc2\xa0incorporation of the\xc2\xa0ISDA master agreement: "This agreement constitutes an\xc2\xa0entire agreement and understanding of the\xc2\xa0parties with respect to its subject matter.  Each of the\xc2\xa0parties acknowledges that in entering into this agreement it has not relied on any order or written representations, warranty or other assurance, except as provided for or referred to in this agreement, and ways or rights or remedies which might otherwise be available to it in respect thereof, except that nothing in this agreement will limit or exclude any liability of a\xc2\xa0party for fraud." (iii)  The\xc2\xa0confirmation also contained a\xc2\xa0representation by UGL in relation to non reliance: "UGL is acting for its own independent decision to enter into this transaction and as to whether this transaction is appropriate or proper for it based upon its own judgment and upon advice from such advisors as it has deemed necessary.  UGL is not relying on any communication, written or oral, of DB as investment advice or as a\xc2\xa0recommendation to enter into this transaction, it being understood that information and explanations relating to the\xc2\xa0terms and conditions of this transaction would not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to enter into this transaction.  No communication, written or oral, received from DB shall be deemed to be an\xc2\xa0assurance or guarantee as to the expected results of this transaction. Assessment and understanding.  UGL is capable of assessing the\xc2\xa0merits of and understanding on its own behalf or through independent professional advice and understands and accepts the terms and conditions and risks of this transaction.  Status of the\xc2\xa0parties, DB is not acting as fiduciary for or an\xc2\xa0adviser for UGL in respect of this transaction." (iv)  The\xc2\xa0term sheet for the\xc2\xa0loan contained the\xc2\xa0following statement:  "This document does not constitute an offer or recommendation to enter into any transaction. We have sent you this document in our capacity as a potential counterparty acting at arm\'s length; we are not acting as your financial advisor or in a fiduciary capacity in respect of this proposed transaction or any other transaction with you unless expressly agreed by us in writing.  Before entering into any transaction, you should take steps to ensure that you understand the\xc2\xa0transaction and have made an\xc2\xa0independent assessment of the\xc2\xa0appropriateness of the\xc2\xa0transaction.  In the\xc2\xa0light of your own objectives and circumstances including the possible risks and benefits of entering into such transaction.  You should also consider seeking advice from your own advisers in making this assessment." As DB AG submit, it was made clear to UGL and Unitech, and accepted by them, that DB\xc2\xa0AG was acting on an\xc2\xa0arms length basis and not as their adviser or fiduciary; that DB\xc2\xa0AG was not making any recommendation and it was Unitech\'s and UGL\'s sole responsibility to understand the transaction and make its own independent assessment of its appropriateness.  Unitech and UGL were relying on their own judgment and DB\xc2\xa0AG was not making any representation as to the\xc2\xa0completeness or accuracy of the\xc2\xa0information in the\xc2\xa0term sheets.\r\n   What, in such circumstances, could a reasonable representee in the position of UGL and Unitech see as a\xc2\xa0representation in relation to the\xc2\xa0LIBOR provisions of either the\xc2\xa0loan or the\xc2\xa0swap agreement?  Both those agreements referred to a\xc2\xa0LIBOR rate as it appeared on a\xc2\xa0screen at a\xc2\xa0particular time.  Where and on what basis could a\xc2\xa0representation be spelt out about the\xc2\xa0way in which that figure came to be found there, or the\xc2\xa0manner in which it came to be calculated? \r\n   The\xc2\xa0terms of the\xc2\xa0LIBOR representations A and B, as pleaded, are concerned with the\xc2\xa0manner in which the\xc2\xa0figure on the screen came to be compiled.  Each of those two alleged representations seeks to place in the\xc2\xa0mouth of one bank, that is known to make a\xc2\xa0report to Thomson Reuters, a\xc2\xa0statement about the\xc2\xa0overall integrity of the\xc2\xa0system or of all the individual bank\'s contributions to it; neither of which lay solely within the control of any individual bank.  As pleaded, every bank participating in any panel on any one of the\xc2\xa0150 LIBOR rates would be taken as making this representation about the\xc2\xa0whole system and the\xc2\xa0parts played by every bank within it.  That, in my judgment, is unrealistic and does not meet the\xc2\xa0test to which I\xc2\xa0have already referred.\r\n   In the\xc2\xa0absence of any express representation, the\xc2\xa0question of representations as to process cannot arise and the\xc2\xa0width and uncertainty of those representations run far beyond anything that any reasonable representee could imagine.  DB\xc2\xa0AG puts it this way in relation to these two representations.  They say that what these representations really amount to is as follows:\r\n   "None of the\xc2\xa0banks on any of the\xc2\xa0ten reporting panels for any of the\xc2\xa0ten currencies in which LIBOR was published had ever made a\xc2\xa0submission which did not constitute a\xc2\xa0good faith accurate estimate of their borrowing costs in a reasonable market size just prior to 11 am London time on any given day, and none of the\xc2\xa0banks on any of those ten panels would ever in the\xc2\xa0future make a\xc2\xa0submission which did not constitute a\xc2\xa0good faith estimate of their borrowing costs in a reasonable market size just prior to 11 am London time on any given day." Representations C and D look a\xc2\xa0little more promising at first blush, being at least linked to DB\xc2\xa0AG\'s acts, intentions or knowledge, but again one has to ask the\xc2\xa0question why, in the\xc2\xa0absence of any express representation, and in the\xc2\xa0context of the\xc2\xa0two transactions that merely had referred to LIBOR rates on screen, (and/or draft documents exchanged earlier which made similar references), any representation of any kind arises in relation to the\xc2\xa0means by which the\xc2\xa0figure is compiled, even allowing for the\xc2\xa0reporting contribution that DB\xc2\xa0AG made to that process.\r\n   Again, there is a\xc2\xa0measure of uncertainty in the\xc2\xa0alleged representation, though Mr\xc2\xa0Brisby QC says that this is more of a\xc2\xa0forensic point than anything else.  The\xc2\xa0question arises as to what is meant by "Undermining the\xc2\xa0integrity" of LIBOR and reference is made to the\xc2\xa0number of LIBOR submissions per year being of the\xc2\xa0order of 446,250.  How many panel banks must be involved before integrity is undermined?  How many submissions must be made, other than in good faith for that to occur?  Does the\xc2\xa0conduct have actually to affect the\xc2\xa0published rate for it to undermine the\xc2\xa0integrity of LIBOR, and would manipulation on a\xc2\xa0single day be sufficient?  Furthermore, if a\xc2\xa0submission was made other than in good faith that related to yen LIBOR or Australian dollar LIBOR would that undermine the\xc2\xa0integrity of LIBOR for the\xc2\xa0purposes of the\xc2\xa0representation.\r\n   There is, to my mind, a\xc2\xa0real difference when entering into a\xc2\xa0transaction which is based on a\xc2\xa0particular LIBOR rate, between an\xc2\xa0implied term of the\xc2\xa0contract that a\xc2\xa0party will not manipulate the\xc2\xa0specific LIBOR rate that is referred to in it, which might well be said to go without saying and, on the other hand, a\xc2\xa0separate non contractual representation that nothing has been done in the\xc2\xa0past, or is now being done, to impact on any of the\xc2\xa0many LIBOR rates calculated in the\xc2\xa0past or a\xc2\xa0representation as to intention as to the\xc2\xa0future.  A\xc2\xa0promise to do nothing that would jeopardise the\xc2\xa0ordinary and proper assessment of the\xc2\xa0relevant particular LIBOR rate to which the\xc2\xa0transaction is linked can, it seems to me, albeit without hearing argument, be readily spelt out of the\xc2\xa0existing provisions in the\xc2\xa0contract, but an\xc2\xa0implied representation of fact when no representation relevant to it is expressly made, whether in the\xc2\xa0contract or elsewhere, and when disclaimers or other clauses in the\xc2\xa0agreement militate against such implication, cannot be found simply on the basis of the\xc2\xa0two features upon which UGL and Unitech alone rely, namely that DB\xc2\xa0AG was a\xc2\xa0panel bank and entered into a\xc2\xa0financial transaction linked to LIBOR.  If representations C and D were made, that would effectively impose upon DB\xc2\xa0AG and any other LIBOR panel bank which entered into a\xc2\xa0LIBOR linked derivative with the\xc2\xa0counterparty a\xc2\xa0positive duty to disclose to the\xc2\xa0counterparty any information which it had which might undermine the\xc2\xa0integrity of LIBOR, whatever that expression really means, and a\xc2\xa0failure to do so would amount to an\xc2\xa0implied misrepresentation.  That does seem a\xc2\xa0very wide duty to impose.\r\n   It is plain, in my judgment, that linking a\xc2\xa0payment obligation to a\xc2\xa0LIBOR rate cannot be enough to give rise to a\xc2\xa0representation about how that LIBOR rate was, is, or will be, compiled; otherwise every contracting party on either/or both sides of a\xc2\xa0contract would make such a representation in the multitude of transactions where such reference is made.  How, then, does the\xc2\xa0fact that one party is a\xc2\xa0panel bank and contributes to reporting for one or more of such rates in itself give rise to the\xc2\xa0implied representation?  If that party participates in the\xc2\xa0scheme for assessment of the relevant rate to which the contract refers an implied promise not to fix the\xc2\xa0rate by reference to extraneous considerations might be inferred since it would specifically relate to proper performance of the\xc2\xa0contract, but I\xc2\xa0do not see how representations of fact of the\xc2\xa0kind suggested can be spelt out just because a\xc2\xa0bank does have a\xc2\xa0reporting function.\r\n   No specific precontractual conduct is relied on in the\xc2\xa0pleading, nor any statements of any kind.  It is merely the\xc2\xa0offer of a\xc2\xa0product and/or the\xc2\xa0conclusion of a\xc2\xa0transaction by a\xc2\xa0panel member which refers to LIBOR which, in themselves, are said to give rise to the\xc2\xa0implied statements.  In my judgment, that is unsustainable and such a\xc2\xa0plea has no prospect of success.\r\n   In  Graiseley v Barclays\xc2\xa0Bank   [2012] EWHC 3093 Comm , Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Flaux allowed amendments to add claims for fraudulent misrepresentation against Barclays in relation to LIBOR.  In paragraph\xc2\xa09 of the\xc2\xa0judgment, he referred to the draft pleadings which set out representations and how they were made by agents of the\xc2\xa0bank, those being managers and staff in the\xc2\xa0local branches in the\xc2\xa0black country.  The\xc2\xa0representations were said to have been made both in documents, including drafts of the\xc2\xa0various agreements which referred on a\xc2\xa0number of occasions to LIBOR, and to the\xc2\xa0setting of the\xc2\xa0so-called screen rate, and a\xc2\xa0series of e-mails passing between the\xc2\xa0bank and the\xc2\xa0claimants and meetings.  How different that was from the\xc2\xa0current case is not apparent, save that there was some material which was expressly pleaded, whereas there is none in the\xc2\xa0present case beyond the\xc2\xa0two features to which I\xc2\xa0have referred.  \r\n   At paragraph\xc2\xa015, Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Flaux referred to the\xc2\xa0principles upon which a\xc2\xa0court decides whether any given representation has been made, as summarised by Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Popplewell in  Mabanga v Ophir Energy  [2012] EWHC 1589  Comm at paragraphs 25 to 28.  He said it was by reference to those principles that the defendants in the\xc2\xa0Barclays case sought to argue that the amendments had no prospect of success.\r\n   I\xc2\xa0refer to Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Popplewell\'s judgment, first to paragraph\xc2\xa025, where he said this:\r\n   "Whether any and, if so, what representation was made has to be judged objectively, according to the\xc2\xa0impact that whatever is said may be expected to have had on a\xc2\xa0reasonable representee in the\xc2\xa0position and with the\xc2\xa0known characteristics of the\xc2\xa0actual representee." Then at paragraph\xc2\xa028: "In the\xc2\xa0case of an\xc2\xa0implied representation, the\xc2\xa0court has to perform a\xc2\xa0similar task, except that it has to consider what a\xc2\xa0reasonable person would have inferred was being implicitly represented by a\xc2\xa0representor\'s words or conduct in that context.   IFE Fund SA v Goldman Sachs and Raiffeisen ZentralBank v RBS , paragraph\xc2\xa083." Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Flaux was, therefore, conscious of the\xc2\xa0test to be applied, but his judgment does not record how it was that he applied it to the\xc2\xa0facts of the\xc2\xa0case before him.  He had self-evidently different materials to those which are before me.  What he did say, however, was this, at paragraph\xc2\xa016:\r\n   "So far as the\xc2\xa0first objection is concerned, which is whether it is appropriate to apply the\xc2\xa0alleged representations at all, the\xc2\xa0United\xc2\xa0States Department of Justice found that, at paragraph 32 of its statements of facts, expressly accepted by Barclays, as is recorded by the Department\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0Justice, albeit in the\xc2\xa0context of the\xc2\xa0activities of derivative traders, that certain of those traders and rate submitters who had engaged in efforts to manipulate LIBOR submissions were well aware of the\xc2\xa0basic features of the\xc2\xa0derivative products tied to these benchmark interest rates.  Accordingly, they understood that to the\xc2\xa0extent they increased their profits or decreased their losses in certain transactions from their efforts to manipulate rates, their counterparties would suffer correspondingly adverse financial consequences in relation to those particular transactions." In my judgment, the\xc2\xa0awareness of the\xc2\xa0representor of the consequences of manipulating LIBOR on contracts that refer to it has no bearing on the\xc2\xa0test to be applied in accordance with the\xc2\xa0dicta of Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Toulson and Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Popplewell.  I\xc2\xa0gain, therefore, no help from that paragraph of Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Flaux\'s judgment.\r\n   At paragraph\xc2\xa017 he went on to say that in his judgment what applied to derivative traders as to their knowledge or understanding should, arguably, hold for senior management of Barclays who were responsible for manipulation of LIBOR.  He went on to say that in those circumstances the\xc2\xa0attempts by the defendants to argue that the implied representations do not reach the\xc2\xa0level of "Real prospect of success" for the\xc2\xa0purpose of allowing the\xc2\xa0amendments was doomed to failure.  He said that whether the\xc2\xa0implied representations would in fact be made out would depend on factual issues which could only be decided at trial and it could not be said that Barclays had an\xc2\xa0unanswerable case that the implied representations were not made.  It was, therefore, quintessentially a\xc2\xa0factual question for determination at trial.\r\n   In the circumstances, I\xc2\xa0can derive no assistance from the\xc2\xa0judgment of Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Flaux in relation to the\xc2\xa0allegations with which I\xc2\xa0have to deal, and the\xc2\xa0factual premises upon which it is suggested that representations should be implied.  Every case will turn upon its own facts when the\xc2\xa0test falls to be applied, but applying it to what is pleaded in the\xc2\xa0draft amendments here results in the\xc2\xa0conclusion that it cannot be met.  One cannot look at what the\xc2\xa0banks knew and what the\xc2\xa0banks did in order to spell out what a\xc2\xa0reasonable person in the\xc2\xa0position of the\xc2\xa0defendants would have inferred was being implicitly represented as existing fact by DB\xc2\xa0AG when contracting by reference to a\xc2\xa0LIBOR rate.  What the\xc2\xa0parties had in mind was the\xc2\xa0LIBOR rate as it came to be shown on the screen in the\xc2\xa0future, not what had been done in the\xc2\xa0past in setting that rate, nor how it would be done in the\xc2\xa0future, nor what any panel banks\' intentions were at the time.  Those thoughts would not have crossed their minds as being representations of existing fact being made by DB\xc2\xa0AG simply by virtue of contracting by reference to LIBOR and by virtue of DB\xc2\xa0AG being a\xc2\xa0panel bank.  \r\n   The\xc2\xa0negligence claim is dependent upon the\xc2\xa0representations being impliedly made or made by conduct, regardless of any issue which might arise on duty of care.  As no foundation has been laid to show the\xc2\xa0representations being made, this claim in the\xc2\xa0amendments falls in limine.  Given the\xc2\xa0terms of the\xc2\xa0disclaimer in the\xc2\xa0swap confirmation and the\xc2\xa0other contractual provisions to which I have referred, I\xc2\xa0do not see how a\xc2\xa0duty of care could be established either.  Reference can there be made to Lord\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Waller in  IMP v GSI  [2007], EWCA 881.  Although, of course, if dishonesty were established the\xc2\xa0position would be seen differently. \r\n   The\xc2\xa0warranty claim in the\xc2\xa0new amendments seems to me to be oddly pleaded.  As framed, it seemed to me to amount to a\xc2\xa0claim that there was a\xc2\xa0collateral contract in the\xc2\xa0shape of the\xc2\xa0alleged warranty-collateral to both the\xc2\xa0swaps confirmation and the\xc2\xa0credit facility agreement.  This, of course, would conflict with the\xc2\xa0entire agreement clause in the\xc2\xa0swaps confirmation insofar as it is said to be a\xc2\xa0collateral contract with UGL, and no allegation is made that it was a\xc2\xa0contract collateral to the\xc2\xa0guarantee.\r\n   Mr\xc2\xa0Brisby told me that it was intended to be a plea of an\xc2\xa0implied term of the\xc2\xa0facility agreement and swap agreement themselves, which would again conflict with the\xc2\xa0entire agreement clause.  Equally, however, the\xc2\xa0warranty is in the\xc2\xa0same terms as the\xc2\xa0misrepresentations relating to past facts, present practice and present intention vis\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0vis LIBOR globally.  With contracts of the\xc2\xa0kind in question and the\xc2\xa0terms to which I\'ve referred, I\xc2\xa0do not see how such warranties could be implied into the\xc2\xa0contract in question by reference to the\xc2\xa0test set out by Lord Hoffman in the\xc2\xa0 Attorney General of Belize  or to any of the forms of words he used to illustrate that test.  Whether one refers to the\xc2\xa0question, whether the\xc2\xa0provision "spells out in express words what the\xc2\xa0instrument read against the relevant background would reasonably be understood to mean" or looks for an\xc2\xa0implied term which is "obvious" or "necessary solely to give business efficacy", or one which "goes without saying" makes no difference.  I\xc2\xa0cannot see how any of these criteria could be in any way satisfied.\r\n   This is, as I\xc2\xa0say, very different from saying that an\xc2\xa0obligation not to manipulate the\xc2\xa0relevant LIBOR rate in the\xc2\xa0future is a\xc2\xa0term which goes without saying.  Even a\xc2\xa0representation of current intention is not the\xc2\xa0same as a\xc2\xa0future obligation not to jeopardise the\xc2\xa0proper process of LIBOR assessment by self-interested action.  In my judgment, none of the\xc2\xa0existing pleas of misrepresentation can stand as implied warranties, though there is, I\xc2\xa0suspect, room for an\xc2\xa0implied term which, during the\xc2\xa0course of argument, Mr\xc2\xa0Brisby had it in mind to allege and may yet be the\xc2\xa0subject of a\xc2\xa0future application to amend.\r\n   I\xc2\xa0am, of course, conscious of all the\xc2\xa0questions of fact which can arise in relation to matters of this kind, but one can only proceed on the basis of what is pleaded as the\xc2\xa0factual premises upon which the\xc2\xa0implication of representations or terms are said to arise\r\n   A new plea is proposed which alleges that because there was no genuine LIBOR rate, the\xc2\xa0interest claimed under the\xc2\xa0facility agreement is irrecoverable.  Alternatively, this plea is put on the basis of public policy.  The\xc2\xa0LIBOR rate on screen is what is referred to in the\xc2\xa0swap agreement and the\xc2\xa0credit facility agreement.  If there is no representation as to how it was to be calculated, then the\xc2\xa0screen rate applies and there is no basis put forward, absent a plea of breach of contractual promise, why that rate should not be applied.  A\xc2\xa0plea of public policy, moreover, without particularisation will not do.  If such a\xc2\xa0plea is to be made, the\xc2\xa0policy reasons must be spelt out.\r\n   I\xc2\xa0turn, then, to the\xc2\xa0question of relief or remedy that is sought in the\xc2\xa0amendments.  I\xc2\xa0am conscious of the\xc2\xa0 Williams\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Humbert  point that is made by Mr\xc2\xa0Brisby in the\xc2\xa0context of matters that are, in any event, going to be the\xc2\xa0subject of investigation at trial, particularly in the\xc2\xa0context of the\xc2\xa0suitability misrepresentation.  Nonetheless, the\xc2\xa0matters to which I\xc2\xa0have already adverted form a\xc2\xa0discrete area of subject matter and they deserve to be dealt with as a\xc2\xa0matter of principle on their own terms.  It is in that context that one then considers the\xc2\xa0question of relief or remedy also.  \r\n   The\xc2\xa0basis upon which the\xc2\xa0proposed pleas seem to be made is that they have the\xc2\xa0consequence of relieving UGL and, therefore, its guarantor, Unitech, of contractual liability under the\xc2\xa0credit facility agreement and the\xc2\xa0swap agreement.  At paragraph\xc2\xa036G in the\xc2\xa0swap action and paragraph\xc2\xa05FB and 5GG in the\xc2\xa0lenders\' action, the\xc2\xa0allegation is made that UGL and Unitech have been irretrievably prejudiced and stand discharged from the\xc2\xa0swap agreement, the\xc2\xa0credit facility agreement, the\xc2\xa0guarantee and the\xc2\xa0indemnity.  The\xc2\xa0basis in law for this allegation is unknown.  \r\n   Moreover, if there is a\xc2\xa0breach of warranty as opposed to a\xc2\xa0misrepresentation act or tortious form of misrepresentation, the\xc2\xa0measure of damages is, ordinarily, based on the assumption that the representations and statements are true as opposed to them never having been made.  That gives rise to damages which essentially reflect the\xc2\xa0difference between any manipulated LIBOR rate applied to the\xc2\xa0contract and that which would have applied in the\xc2\xa0absence of such manipulation, not relief from the\xc2\xa0basic obligation of repayment of the\xc2\xa0loan. \r\n   Similarly, repudiation of the\xc2\xa0agreements is not alleged, but if it was, damages would be of the\xc2\xa0same kind and the\xc2\xa0loan of the\xc2\xa0principal sum of $150\xc2\xa0million would then fall to be taken into account, dwarfing, I\xc2\xa0suspect, any possible damages which could conceivably be alleged by UGL or Unitech. \r\n   Additional complications arise in the\xc2\xa0lenders\' action, because the\xc2\xa0second to ninth claimants were not panel members and acceded to the\xc2\xa0credit facility agreement under clause\xc2\xa029 by transfer or novation.  UGL and Unitech allege in paragraph 5G1(2) to paragraphs G1.4 that there was a\xc2\xa0second LIBOR warranty given in the\xc2\xa0context of the\xc2\xa0transfer/novations, either forming a\xc2\xa0collateral contract to those transfers or novations or as part of them.  \r\n   No separate basis is pleaded for this, so that the pleas fall with my earlier conclusions.\r\n   The\xc2\xa0alleged second LIBOR warranty accords with representations A and B alone, to which I\xc2\xa0have already referred.  As none of the\xc2\xa0second to ninth claimants was a\xc2\xa0LIBOR panel member, one of the\xc2\xa0two building blocks for the\xc2\xa0alleged implied misrepresentation is absent, and for the\xc2\xa0reasons given earlier, no representation can be implied simply from the\xc2\xa0conclusion of the\xc2\xa0transaction by a\xc2\xa0party by reference to LIBOR.  How can any accession change that or improve the\xc2\xa0defendant\'s position as compared with that of DB\xc2\xa0AG?  The\xc2\xa0second to ninth claimants would know nothing of the\xc2\xa0actual processes by which LIBOR rates were actually set, and whether any panel members\' submissions were good faith accurate estimates or not.  How could any such representation arise on their accession to the\xc2\xa0credit facility agreement, whatever the\xc2\xa0mechanism for that accession? \r\n   Here the\xc2\xa0documents show that there were transfers by way of novation, or by way of assignment, assumption and release, to all of which UGL agreed in advance by virtue of clause\xc2\xa029 of the\xc2\xa0credit facility agreement.  Two particular transfers, those to the\xc2\xa0seventh claimant and to the\xc2\xa0third claimant, were expressly effected by novation.  The\xc2\xa0effect of novation is, as is known, not simply to assign or transfer a\xc2\xa0right or liability, but to extinguish the\xc2\xa0existing agreement and create a\xc2\xa0new contract.  Now, the\xc2\xa0importance of that is said to be that any right to rescind, which the\xc2\xa0defendants might have had in relation to the\xc2\xa0original credit facility agreement, was lost when that agreement was extinguished and replaced by new, novated, agreements.  That must be right. \r\n   Furthermore, reference is made to the\xc2\xa0principle that rescission is unavailable where the\xc2\xa0rights of third parties are involved, if those third parties have acquired rights in the\xc2\xa0subject matter of a\xc2\xa0contract.  In a\xc2\xa0multi-lateral contract situation, where some parties are innocent, there is also a\xc2\xa0problem in asserting rescission, because it cannot be effected against one party but not another.  That too is correct. \r\n   The\xc2\xa0other claimants appear to have acquired rights by way of "Assignment, assumption and release".  Those are said to be also a\xc2\xa0form of novation, to which the\xc2\xa0same principles apply, but it matters not in the\xc2\xa0current context because of the\xc2\xa0two particular claimants to whose position I\xc2\xa0have already referred.\r\n   Paragraph\xc2\xa05FA of the\xc2\xa0draft amendments to the\xc2\xa0defence in the\xc2\xa0lenders\' action asserts an\xc2\xa0assumption of liability or responsibility by the acceding parties for any representations, or breaches of express or implied terms by DB\xc2\xa0AG or an\xc2\xa0implied term of the\xc2\xa0novations to the\xc2\xa0same effect.  There is, however, nothing in the\xc2\xa0terms of any of the\xc2\xa0novation documents which have been produced which could give rise to any implication or assumption and there is no plea of any other factual basis upon which these matters could arise.  \r\n   Clause\xc2\xa029 of the\xc2\xa0credit facility agreement provides for both methods of \'transfer\',  whether by novation or assignment, assumption and release, to be effected by use of a\xc2\xa0transfer certificate to which the\xc2\xa0old lenders, the\xc2\xa0new lenders and the\xc2\xa0facility agent are parties.  That was the\xc2\xa0method that was employed in each case for each of these claimants, as is clear from the\xc2\xa0evidence adduced and the\xc2\xa0exhibits to it.\r\n   The\xc2\xa0terms of clause 29(5) provide for the\xc2\xa0new lender to assume the\xc2\xa0rights and obligations of DB\xc2\xa0AG expressed to be the\xc2\xa0subject of the\xc2\xa0novation or assumption in the\xc2\xa0transfer certificate itself.  That transfer certificate, in each case, expressly provided for the\xc2\xa0assumption of "Obligations equivalent to those obligations of DB\xc2\xa0AG under the facility agreement," not to any obligation under any collateral contract nor obligations arising from misrepresentation.  This pleas cannot succeed.  \r\n   A\xc2\xa0final difficulty is raised by Mr\xc2\xa0Handyside in his skeleton at paragraphs\xc2\xa060 through to 64 in relation to the\xc2\xa0remedy of damages which is sought under the\xc2\xa0Misrepresentation Act because of the\xc2\xa0terms of section\xc2\xa02.2 of that Act which provide that an\xc2\xa0award of damages can be given under the\xc2\xa0act in lieu of the\xc2\xa0remedy of rescission.  But such an\xc2\xa0award can only be given where rescission is still available, as the\xc2\xa0authorities which he cites show.   \r\n   That, I\xc2\xa0think, deals with all the\xc2\xa0amendments that are currently sought, unless there is something that I\xc2\xa0have failed to notice and to which my attention can be drawn.  But, as matters stand, despite the\xc2\xa0low threshold which Mr\xc2\xa0Brisby rightly says is to be applied by the court in allowing amendments, despite the\xc2\xa0early stage at which these amendments are sought, and despite the\xc2\xa0absence of any limitation problem, the\xc2\xa0application of the appropriate test, of no reasonable prospect of success, means that none of those amendments, at least in their current form and on the basis of the\xc2\xa0facts put forward to justify them, can be justified.  They are, therefore, not allowed.\r\n   '
