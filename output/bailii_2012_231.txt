b'  MR JUSTICE TEARE:   This is the trial of an\xc2\xa0action in which two Merrill\xc2\xa0Lynch entities, Merrill Lynch International Bank Limited and Merrill Lynch International, seek a\xc2\xa0number of declarations against the defendant, the Comune\xc2\xa0Di\xc2\xa0Verona.\r\n   \tIt has been an\xc2\xa0unusual trial, which took place yesterday.  The defendant filed a\xc2\xa0defence saying that the claim does not disclose a\xc2\xa0cause of action, that there is no real or present dispute between the parties and that the claimant\'s claims are an\xc2\xa0abuse of the process of the court.  Yet, despite filing such a\xc2\xa0defence, the defendant failed to attend the trial to advance those contentions.\r\n   \tThe claimants have been represented by Mr\xc2\xa0Handyside\xc2\xa0QC.  He and his junior, Mr\xc2\xa0Sher, have prepared a\xc2\xa0very full skeleton argument in which the basis of the claimant\'s claim and the reasons why it is appropriate to grant declaratory relief have been set out in full and commendable detail, by reference to many of the relevant modern authorities.  \r\n   \tIn addition, counsel have considered what arguments the defendant might have advanced in support of its pleaded defence and have explained why those points should not be regarded as good reasons for refusing the declaratory relief which has been sought.\r\n   \tThe claimant\'s claim arises out of an\xc2\xa0amortising interest rate swap and sinking fund transaction.  The transaction was initially entered into in\xc2\xa0October\xc2\xa02006, but was subject to an\xc2\xa0amendment or restructuring dated\xc2\xa0April\xc2\xa02007.  \r\n   \tThe transaction is governed by the terms of a\xc2\xa01992 ISDA Master Agreement and schedule thereto, dated\xc2\xa0December\xc2\xa02006.  The transaction is governed by English law and, within the European\xc2\xa0Union, is subject to an\xc2\xa0exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the English courts.  \r\n   \tThe transaction derives from three earlier transactions, which it supersedes.  They have been referred to as the "first", "second" and "third" transaction.  The present transaction has been referred to as the "fourth transaction".\r\n   \tThe reason why the proceedings have been commenced are to be found in (a) meetings and telephone calls between the parties in late 2009 and early 2010; and (b) media reports in Italy between\xc2\xa0October\xc2\xa02010 and\xc2\xa0January\xc2\xa02011.  \r\n   \tThe meetings and telephone calls are summarised in paragraphs 19 to 23 of the skeleton argument and are derived from the evidence of Mr\xc2\xa0Sallustio, the claimant\'s Italian lawyer, who gave oral evidence before the court.\r\n   \tIt is apparent from his evidence that the defendant, in the wake of criminal investigations in Italy involving other cities and other banks, wished to restructure the transaction in a\xc2\xa0manner which did not appeal to the claimants.  \r\n   \tWhen it became apparent, in\xc2\xa0March\xc2\xa02010, that the claimants did not agree with the suggested restructuring, the defendants said that the parties would "see each other in the relevant venues", which Mr\xc2\xa0Sallustio understood, probably correctly, as "see you in court".\r\n   \tThese proceedings were then commenced in\xc2\xa0July\xc2\xa02010.  In them the claimant seeks several declarations; the effect, in broad terms, being that the transaction was binding on the defendant.  \r\n   \tThe media reports to which I\xc2\xa0was referred reported that the Mayor of Verona intended to challenge the proceedings and that he had alleged that the defendant had paid more than was due.  Other reports mentioned that the defendants intended "to wage war" with the claimant.  Mention was made of an\xc2\xa0allegation that hidden commissions had been paid.  The mayor was reported as saying that it was right that the transaction be judged in an\xc2\xa0Italian court.  Those media reports are summarised in paragraph\xc2\xa026 of the skeleton argument.\r\n   \tBecause the defendant\'s solicitor said that the media reports published after the date on which proceedings had been commenced could not be relied on by the claimants, a\xc2\xa0further action was issued, relying upon those matters in order to show that there was a\xc2\xa0dispute between the parties.  The two actions have been consolidated.\r\n   \tIn\xc2\xa0July\xc2\xa02011 the first CMC took place.  Mr\xc2\xa0Justice David Steel made clear that if the defendant wished to raise any issue not pleaded at that time, it must do so.  It could not have an\xc2\xa0argument as to whether it was appropriate to grant declaratory relief and, if it lost that argument, bring forward further allegations at a\xc2\xa0later date.  An\xc2\xa0opportunity was therefore given for an\xc2\xa0amended defence by 30\xc2\xa0September\xc2\xa02011.  When it was served, no positive case was advanced beyond that which had already been pleaded.\r\n   \tAt a\xc2\xa0further CMC in\xc2\xa0November\xc2\xa02011, I\xc2\xa0gave directions for trial of the claimant\'s claim for declaratory relief.  The defendant informed the court that it would not be taking any steps with regard to disclosure or evidence.  That has proved to be the case.\r\n   \tOn the basis of the sole point taken in the defence, Mr\xc2\xa0Handyside has submitted that there are three Issues for the court to determine.  Firstly, does the claim disclose a\xc2\xa0cause of action?  Secondly, is there a\xc2\xa0real and present dispute between the claimant and the defendants?  Thirdly, if so, should the court exercise its discretion to grant the declarations sought?\r\n   \tThe first issue, therefore, is whether there is a\xc2\xa0need for there to be an\xc2\xa0independent cause of action.  This arises because the defendant has not in fact failed to pay any sum which is due to the claimant.  \r\n   \tHowever, as explained by Mr\xc2\xa0Handyside in paragraph\xc2\xa055 of his skeleton argument, there is no need for an\xc2\xa0independent cause of action.  That is stated both in the notes to The\xc2\xa0White\xc2\xa0Book and in the authority of Gouriet v Union of Post Office Workers  [1978] AC 435 , at page\xc2\xa0501.\r\n   \tThe second issue to be determined is whether there is a\xc2\xa0real and present dispute between the parties.  This arises because such a\xc2\xa0dispute is generally required before it is appropriate for the court to exercise its jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief; see Rolls\xc2\xa0Royce\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Unite  [2010] 1 WLR 318 , at paragraph\xc2\xa0120.  In determining whether this requirement is satisfied, the court now takes a\xc2\xa0pragmatic approach; see Messier\xc2\xa0Dowty v Sabena  [2000] 1 WLR 2040 .  The court looks to see whether the claimant has a\xc2\xa0real commercial interest in the declaratory relief sought; see Nokia\xc2\xa0Corporation v Interdigital\xc2\xa0Technology  [2006] EWCA Civ 1618 . The existence of a\xc2\xa0real and present dispute can be shown by the making of a\xc2\xa0veiled threat to issue proceedings; see L\'Oreal v Johnson\xc2\xa0&\xc2\xa0Johnson [2000] ETMR 691.  A\xc2\xa0fuller account of those and other authorities can be found at paragraphs\xc2\xa061 to 66 of the skeleton argument. \r\n   \tI\xc2\xa0accept Mr\xc2\xa0Handyside\'s submission that, on the facts of this case, which I\xc2\xa0have summarised, there has been, in reality, a\xc2\xa0threat by the defendant to commence proceedings in Italy to recover alleged overpayments and commission.  The defendant\'s solicitors have said in correspondence that the defendant has never intended, and "as matters presently stand" does not intend to commence proceedings in Italy, but there is no evidence to that effect.  What evidence there is suggests the contrary.\r\n   \tAt paragraph\xc2\xa070 of his skeleton argument Mr\xc2\xa0Handyside has suggested four arguments which might have been advanced by the defendant had it been represented at the trial.  They are: firstly, there is no dispute, because the defendant is continuing to make payments under swap transaction; secondly, the facts and matters pleaded in the reply relating to the discussions between the parties and the media reports are not sufficient evidence of a\xc2\xa0real or present dispute; thirdly, the matters relied upon, which postdate the original claim, cannot be relied upon; fourthly, the interviews given by the defendant and the reports in the Italian press relied upon by the claimant cannot be used as evidence to justify the proceedings, because they were allegedly responsive to the service of proceedings by the claimant in England and are therefore not significant, as to treat them as significant would be to give the claimant the benefit of the illegitimate conduct of which the defendant complains.\r\n   \tI\xc2\xa0do not consider that any of those arguments would avail the defendants, for the reasons set out by Mr\xc2\xa0Handyside in paragraphs 72 to 76 of the skeleton argument.  \r\n   \tIn short, there has been a\xc2\xa0very clear threat to pursue proceedings against the claimant in Italy.  It is true that such intention has been disavowed by the defendant\'s solicitors in correspondence, but the events and media reports from late 2009 to early 2011 clearly evince such a\xc2\xa0threat.  \r\n   \tThere is nothing in the point that matters which postdated the original claim cannot be relied upon, because that defect, if it was a\xc2\xa0defect, has been cured by the second action.  \r\n   \tThere is, therefore, in the material sense, a\xc2\xa0clear and present dispute between the parties.\r\n   \tThe third question is whether the court should exercise its discretion to grant the declarations which have been sought.\r\n   \tApart from the final two declarations, the declarations sought stem from representations made by the defendant in the transaction and from other terms of the transactions; for example, the representation by the defendant that its obligations are valid and binding.  \r\n   \tThe court can be satisfied that such declarations can properly be made, because the defendant is contractually estopped from denying the truth of these matters; see JP\xc2\xa0Morgan\xc2\xa0Chase v Springwell [2010] EWCA 1221, at paragraphs 141 to 169.   \r\n   \tThe claimant has an\xc2\xa0obvious commercial interest in clarifying the validity of the transactions, which are of substantial value. The claimant has a\xc2\xa0legitimate interest in ensuring that the parties chosen forum, this court, resolves disputes concerning the transactions. In the light of the exclusive jurisdiction clause and of the Judgments Convention, which places emphasis on the court first seized, the claimant has a\xc2\xa0legitimate interest in not being harassed by proceedings against it in Italy.  This is not a\xc2\xa0case where judgment is being sought in default of a\xc2\xa0defence; there has been a\xc2\xa0defence.  Judgment is being sought after a\xc2\xa0trial in which evidence has been adduced.\r\n   \tIn my judgment, the doing of justice in this case requires that the declarations which have been sought should be granted.  The importance of the court doing justice is emphasised by the authorities referred to in paragraph\xc2\xa083 of the skeleton argument, in particular Patten\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Burke\xc2\xa0Publishing [1991] 1 WLR 541, and JP\xc2\xa0Morgan v Primacom\xc2\xa0Management [2005] EWHC 2426 Com.  \r\n   \tHaving regard to the representations made by the defendant, and the other terms of the transactions, there is no injustice to the defendant in granting the declarations sought.  \r\n   \tFor those reasons, I\xc2\xa0shall make the declarations numbers 1 to 11 in the draft order.  They reflect the representations and other terms of the transactions as indicated in the table of comparison between the wording of the declarations sought and the wording of the representations and terms, which has been helpfully prepared by counsel.\r\n   \tThere are two further declarations which are sought in the draft order, they are numbers 12 and 13.  It is necessary to read them.\r\n   \t12 is as follows: \r\n   "Save, as set out in the first transaction documents, the second transaction documents, the third transaction documents or the fourth transaction documents, the first and second claimants assumed no obligation, duty or other responsibility, whether of a contractual, tortious, fiduciary or other nature and whether pre-contractual or otherwise, to the defendant arising out of or in connection with each such transaction; and/or alternatively any such duty obligation or responsibility undertaken by the first and second claimants have to date been lawfully performed and discharged without breach." \tDeclaration 13 provides: \r\n   "The first and/or second claimants have to date fully complied with and/or discharged each and all of their relevant obligations arising out of or in connection with the first transaction documents; the second transaction documents; the third transaction documents; and the fourth transaction documents.  And, accordingly, the first and/or second claimant have not caused and are not liable to the defendant in respect of any loss or damage, which the defendant may have suffered arising out of or in connection with the first transaction, the second transaction, the third transaction or the fourth transaction, whether in contract, tort, statute or otherwise." \tThese two declarations do not derive from the representations and terms of the transactions.  They are wide-ranging; in short, a\xc2\xa0declaration that the claimants have no liability to the defendants of any sort whether, contractual, tortious, fiduciary or of any other nature.  \r\n   \tNo evidence has been led on this topic for the very obvious reason that the defendant has not advanced any case that the claimant has acted in breach of any duty to the defendant.  \r\n   \tAlthough the absence of evidence is understandable, the fact is that the court is being asked to make a\xc2\xa0declaration of non-liability in the absence of any evidence on the question.  That seems to me to be a\xc2\xa0serious obstacle in the claimant\'s way.\r\n   \tMr\xc2\xa0Handyside sought to get over that obstacle in this way: he submitted that the defendant should not be in a\xc2\xa0better position by reason of not having advanced a\xc2\xa0positive case of breach of duty than it would have been in had it advanced such a\xc2\xa0case. If it had pleaded a\xc2\xa0positive case of breach of duty and failed to establish it, the defendant would, as a\xc2\xa0matter of English law and res judicata, and following the principles set out in Henderson\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Henderson, be estopped from thereafter advancing any other case of breach of duty.  \r\n   \tA\xc2\xa0declaration of non-liability will simply put the claimants in the same position.  That, it is said, is fair and appropriate in circumstances where Mr\xc2\xa0Justice\xc2\xa0Steel made clear that if the defendant had any such complaints about the conduct of the claimants, they should be pleaded and not reserved for some later date.\r\n   \tThat is an\xc2\xa0attractive submission.  However, I\xc2\xa0am not persuaded that it is appropriate for the court to make declarations when there is no evidence to support them.  I\xc2\xa0must therefore refuse to make declarations 12 and 13.  \r\n   \tThis court cannot itself restrain the defendant from commencing proceedings in Italy.  If the defendant does so, it will be a\xc2\xa0matter for the Italian courts to determine whether that should be permitted, in the light of the jurisdiction clause in the transaction documents, in the light of the fact that this court is the court first seized, pursuant to the Judgments Convention, and in the light of the declarations that the court has made.\r\n       '
