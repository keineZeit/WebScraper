b'Mr Justice Cresswell: Introduction The claimant ("BP") claims on its own behalf and on behalf of 37 co-insureds listed in Schedule 1 to the Particulars of Claim.  The co-insureds are various oil and gas entities, including some foreign-government owned entities.\r   The nine defendants are identified in Schedule 2 to the Particulars of Claim.  They are either insurance companies (first to third defendants) or Lloyd\'s syndicates (fourth to ninth defendants), each of whom subscribed a slip later superseded by a Binder/Global Construction Insurance Policy ("the Open Cover") led by AIG and SR International Business Insurance Co Ltd ("Swiss Re").  The first to seventh defendants subscribed directly.  The eighth and ninth defendants were bound (with their agreement) to it under a broker\'s cover issued by them to BP\'s brokers Aon Limited ("Aon").  The defendants together represent 41.667% of the following market subscribing the Open Cover in respect of offshore project risks.\r   The Open Cover was placed, and has since been administered, by Aon. \r   In its original form, the Open Cover provided a facility by way of standing offer for the insurance against specified categories of risk of Amoco Corporation (together with all its subsidiary, affiliated, associated and/or interrelated companies and/or their shareholders, and its co-venturers, project managers and/or financiers).  Amoco Corporation merged with The British Petroleum Company Plc with effect from 31 December 1998.  The named insured was amended to BP Amoco plc (together with its subsidiaries etc.).\r   The Binder/Global Construction Insurance Policy was scratched by AIG and Swiss Re (as the leading underwriters) on 18 May 1999 and 19 July 1999 respectively.  The defendants now accept that they are bound by the terms of this policy, which I refer to as the "Open Cover".\r   The Open Cover permitted declarations to be made in respect of both onshore and offshore projects.  These proceedings relate only to offshore projects.  For offshore projects, the period of the Open Cover (within which declarations could be made) was between 1 January 1999 and 30 June 2000.  Disregarding five declarations that were cancelled shortly after being made, the claimant contends that twenty-six offshore declarations were made during that period.  \r   The relief sought by BP is a declaration that the contracts of insurance the subject of the 26 declarations made under the Open Cover are valid and subsisting contracts of insurance, and that the defendants are obliged to indemnify BP and its co-insureds in respect of claims thereunder.  \r   The Amended Defence alleges estoppel by convention, material non-disclosure and/or misrepresentation and breach of collateral warranties.  The defendants counterclaim a number of declarations, including declarations:- \r   (1)\tthat the defendants are entitled to and have validly avoided the Open Cover and/or each of declarations 8-26; and/or (2)\tthat upon its true construction declarations 1-26 do not fall within the terms of the Open Cover and/or are non-contractual and ineffective; and/or (3)\tthat the claimants are estopped by convention from contending that each or any of declarations 8 to 26 give rise to a binding contract of insurance.   On 15 March 2002, Colman J. ordered that there should be a trial of preliminary issues relating to the meaning of the Open Cover and the effect of declarations made under it.  The precise terms of the preliminary issues were subsequently agreed between the parties, and are set out in Schedule 1 to the Order of Toulson J. dated 15 November 2002.  \r\n \xc2\xa0 The Preliminary Issues     The preliminary issues are as follows:-\r   1.\tSo far as the claimant and each of the defendants are concerned, are the terms of the Open Cover contained in the Open Cover slip or in the relevant Binder/Global Construction Insurance Policy, including the endorsement thereto scratched by the defendants (save for the 8 th  and 9 th  defendants) in February 1999?  [The defendants conceded on Day 1 of the trial that the terms of the Open Cover were contained in the Binder/Global Construction Insurance Policy (including endorsements) stamped by Swiss Re on 19 July 1999]. 2.\tOn a true construction of the Open Cover (as determined in 1 above), in order for a project validly to be declared thereunder: (i)\tWas it necessary for the project to commence during (and neither before nor after) the period of the Open Cover? (ii)\tAlternatively is the commencement of the project irrelevant to the operation of the Open Cover and, rather, does the declared date of inception of the project risk, selected at the claimant\'s discretion, determine the start date of the period of insurance for each project? (iii)\tWas it necessary for the declaration to be made: (I)\tno later than 30 days after the project commencement date; and/or \t(II)\twithin the period of the Open Cover? (iv)\tWas it necessary for the declaration to be presented by the claimant or its agent Aon to each of the first to ninth defendants during the period of Open Cover or presented to the Leader alone during the period of the Open Cover, or was it not necessary for it to be presented to any of the defendants during the period of the Open Cover? 3.\tIf the project commencement date is relevant in the context of the answers to Issues 2(i) to 2(iii) above, then on a true construction of the Open Cover, when did a project commence for the purposes of the insurance?  In particular: (i)\tCould a project commence prior to physical construction of the project commencing and/or any parts or materials coming at risk of an Insured? (ii)\tIf the answer to 3(i) above is "No", do plans and/or documents and/or blueprints and/or renderings and/or specifications and/or contract documents and/or models in connection with a project constitute parts and/or materials for this purpose? 4.\tIn the light of the answers to issues 1 to 3 above (taking account of who has the burden of proving the matters referred to), which (if any) of the declarations numbered 5, 12, 14 and 26 were validly declared by the claimant to the Open Cover? \xc2\xa0 \r\nThe Open Cover The slip was scratched between January and March 1999.  It identified the terms of the facility conferred, and summarized the terms of the insurance, which would apply when a valid declaration was made. \r   The slip stated:-\r   "Type: Construction All Risks Open Cover Form: J(a) plus modified Aon Erection/Construction All Risk, Cargo, Delay in Start-up and Third Party Liability wording as more fully defined in the policy wording attached with any amendments to be agreed Leading Underwriter only, wording as agreed L/U only." The policy was prepared in April 1999, different copies of which were scratched by AIG on 18 May 1999 and by Swiss Re on 19 July 1999.  The copy scratched by AIG was also scratched by Aegis.  It is in two sections.  The first is headed "Binder of Insurance Terms and Conditions" ("the Binder").  The second section is headed "Global Construction Insurance Policy ("GCIP")".\r   A further policy was scratched by Swiss Re on 16 November 2001, bearing the Policy Number 823/EL9801152.\r   The IUA policy was issued in about October 2001 on behalf of ERC Frankona (the first defendant), QBE (the second defendant), Hannover (the third defendant) and Axa (not a party to this action).\r   No Lloyd\'s Policy was issued.\r   The Open Cover was a facultative/obligatory contract.  It was a standing offer whereby the defendants agreed to accept liability in respect of any declarations made within the terms of the cover.  BP was free to choose in its own interest which projects to declare to the Open Cover, and which projects to insure under other arrangements or not at all.  The defendants were bound to accept liability in respect of all of BP\'s declarations, which fell within the terms of the cover.  \r   \xc2\xa0 \r\nThe material terms of the Open Cover are as follows:\r   [THE BINDER] "BP Amoco PLC  Global Construction Insurance Binder of Insurance Terms and Conditions Type:\t\t\tConstruction All Risks Open Coverage Named Insured:\t\t BP Amoco PLC (see enclosed policy) Additional Assureds:\t As designated by BP Amoco PLC.

ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED." \xc2\xa0 \r\nThe Claimant\'s Case The claimant\'s case is as follows.\r   The following are the only requirements for a valid declaration to the Open Cover which are material to the issues pleaded in this action:\r   (a)\tAn identifiable project must have reached or be reasonably expected within a reasonable time to reach any of the phases referred to in the fourth paragraph under the heading \'Individual Declarations\' in clause 5 of GCIP Declarations, including the design and engineering phase. \t(b)\tThe declaration must be made within the period of the Open Cover, but as regards all the defendants, a declaration is made at the time when it was made to the leading Underwriters (Swiss Re and AIG), irrespective of the time when it was advised or shown to the defendants. \t(c)\tThe declaration must (i) be for an inception date selected at the option of the claimant, save that it must be within the period of the Open Cover, and (ii) be within a reasonable time before or after the declared inception date or the time when any part of subject-matter of the insurance has become at the risk of an Insured (whichever is later). For the purposes of the Open Cover, a project commences at the commencement of the earliest phase referred to in the fourth paragraph under the heading \'Individual Declarations\' in clause 5 of GCIP Declarations, irrespective of the time when physical construction begins or is expected to begin.\r   All of declarations 5, 12, 14 and 26 were validly made to the Open Cover.\r   The Defendants\' Case The defendants\' case is as follows and they seek the following declarations:\r   1.\tThat a declaration to the Open Cover would only give rise to a binding contract of insurance if the "project" the subject of the declaration actually commenced construction prior to the expiry of the Open Cover, the contract of insurance taking effect on the date of commencement of construction, and if the declaration was made no later than 30 days after the commencement of construction.  For a project to have actually commenced construction, it was necessary for contracts to have been let to a contractor (probably the main contractor) and for physical construction work to have started by a contractor at the site or possibly on shore or to have been due to start imminently. 2.\tAlternatively to 1, that a declaration to the Open Cover would only give rise to a binding contract of insurance at the date of declaration if, at that date, the "project" to which it related: \t(a)\teither had already actually commenced construction and the declaration was made no more than 30 days after the commencement of construction; or \t(b)\twas bona fide estimated to commence construction prior to the expiry of the Open Cover. 3.\tIf, and contrary to the Underwriters\' primary case, on a true construction of clause 4 GCIP Declarations, a "project" is to be treated as having commenced at any stage earlier than the commencement of construction, that a declaration in respect of such a "project" was required to be declared, if to be insured, no later than 30 days after such commencement. 4.\tThat, in order to make a contract of insurance with an underwriter subscribing to the Open Cover, a declaration was required to be made to such underwriter prior to the expiry of the Open Cover, the declaration to such underwriter being the means by which a contract of insurance would be made with him. The Witnesses Of the claimant\'s factual witnesses Mr William Siebenaler, Mr David Brown and Mr Michael Mangino were called to give evidence.  The witness statements of Mr John Green, Mr Bradley Jorgenson and Mr Colin Gordon were admitted by agreement under the Civil Evidence Act.  The statement of Mr Luyties was admitted under the Civil Evidence Act.\r   The defendants called Mr Andrew Pembroke to give evidence.\r   The witness statements contained a considerable amount of material that was inadmissible (e.g. declarations of subjective intent).  The parties suggested that it was more efficient in terms of time to leave arguments about admissibility to final speeches, and this course was followed.  \r   I was assisted by the evidence from the claimant\'s witnesses as to the progress of the four sample transactions and by Mr Siebenaler\'s evidence as to the stages/phases of projects in general.\r   To the extent that Mr Pembroke sought to explain what he thought the policy was intended to cover, this was inadmissible.  Further Mr Sumption QC demonstrated in cross-examination of Mr Pembroke that a number of the broad statements in Mr Pembroke\'s evidence were not justified.  Further Mr Pembroke had only seen one facultative /obligatory open cover (the Open Cover) in 14 years.  Mr Pembroke\'s evidence by way of broad generalisation as to facultative placements was not consistent with certain sample risks written by him and others.\r   The Expert Evidence The claimant called Mr Peter Coffey as an expert witness.  The defendants called Mr Christopher Compton-Rickett as an expert witness.\r   I will refer to the expert evidence below.\r   The Claimant\'s Submissions Mr Jonathan Sumption QC for the claimant submitted as follows.\r   The preliminary issues fall to be decided by (i) construing the language of the Open Cover and (ii) implying such further terms, and only such further terms, as are required by law or truly necessary to make the express terms workable. The relevant background is the practicalities of offshore construction in the oil and gas industry. For the limited purpose of dealing with the procedure for operating the Open Cover, the background also includes the practices of the insurance market. That is all.\r   The question - at what stage of a project may it be declared to the Open Cover?, is answered by the express terms of the contract and by certain basic principles of insurance law. In summary, the position is as follows:\r    (1)\tInsurance is available under the Open Cover in respect of \'projects\'.  There must therefore be an identifiable \'project\' in existence at the time of the declaration to which it relates. But for this purpose the project means the entire project, including all the phases said to make up the \'Insured Project\' in para. (6) of the Period of Insurance clause. There is nothing in the contract and no need to imply any restriction which would tie the making of declarations to any particular phase. (2)\tA declaration must be made either before, or within a reasonable time after, the contract attaches to any part of the subject-matter, and in any event before a known loss. For this purpose, the contract attaches to a part of the subject-matter at such time on or after the declared inception date as it becomes at an Insured\'s risk. (3)\tIn addition, under the general law, the Insured must, at the time of the declaration, either have an insurable interest at risk or reasonably expect to acquire one. A declaration must be made during the period of the Open Cover, i.e. in the case of offshore risks between 1 January 1999 and 30 June 2000. The making of a declaration is matter of market procedure. What constitutes a declaration and when it is treated as having been made are questions which must be answered either by the express terms of the Open Cover, or by the practice of the market in which the declaration is made:\r   (1)\tThe effect of the Leading Underwriter endorsement to the Policy is that a declaration to the Open Cover is validly made to all insurers if it is validly made to the leading underwriters, Swiss Re and AIG. This is because the endorsement authorises them to deal with the administration of the Cover on the market\'s behalf including \'additions\' to the Cover, which include declarations. As a matter of practice it will then be advised to the following market in due course. (2)\tIf, however, this is wrong, and the contract is silent on the point, then the declaration must be shown or advised to every insurer, but where the Cover is obligatory on the Insurer\'s side, the market procedure is that there is a single date, namely the date of declaration to the leaders, on which the declaration is treated as being made to the whole market. This is not because the leading underwriters have any authority on behalf of the followers. It is simply because where the declaration process extends over a period of time, the date on which it is made to the leaders fixes the date of the declaration. Subject to these points:\r   (1)\tThe commencement of the project (however defined) is irrelevant to the right to make a declaration. (2)\tIt is not necessary for the commencement of the project (however defined) to fall within the period of the Open Cover. Clause 4 of GCIP Declarations (Automatic Acquisition) is irrelevant to the issues now before the Court. It is not intended to restrict declarations to a period before 30 days have elapsed from the \'commencement of the project\' (however defined). It is simply a limited additional facility by which certain risks may be insured and losses recoverable without a declaration.\r   The parties to the London Cover (D8 and D9) were in a special position by comparison with the other defendants, because Aon was their agent for the purposes of administering that cover. The agreement between them and Aon was that declarations to the Open Cover were to be administered under the machinery agreed for the London Cover, which involved periodic bordereaux.\r   All of the four sample projects were declared to the Open Cover during the Period of Insurance defined by the Policy and at a stage when interests insured under the Open Cover terms were at risk. In three of the four cases significant further interests were believed to be about to become at risk. These projects were declared to the leading underwriters (as well as to certain of the followers) before the expiry of the Open Cover. They were all perfectly proper declarations and ought to have been accepted as such. The actual reason for their rejection appears to have had nothing to do with the issues presently under consideration, but to have arisen wholly from the Insurers\' view that there was a premium income limit on what could be declared over the life of the Cover.\r   The Defendants\' submissions Mr Mark Howard QC for the defendants submitted as follows.\r   The need for commencement of construction within the period of the Open Cover The Open Cover needs to be construed by reference to its commercial background and purpose.\r   The classic purpose of Construction All Risks insurance is to provide insurance against physical loss or damage to the works being executed and liabilities which may be incurred in the course of the execution of the construction.\r   In a facultative placement, the parties define the moment when these risks are expected to arise. That can be done by reference to a specific calendar date related to when parts and materials are first at risk or, commonly, a particular stage of the project when parts and materials are expected to come at risk, e.g. commencement of works, commencement of fabrication, commencement of procurement, first letting of contracts.\r   It would have been a most surprising omission for the parties to the Open Cover to have failed to identify the stage of a project when insurance was required and the project should become declarable and to have left this wholly to BP\'s discretion.  For the purposes of the risks to be insured under the Open Cover, the parties chose a touchstone or trigger which is well known and often used in the insurance of construction risks, the commencement of construction.  This is evident from the questionnaires which define the "project period" i.e. the period for which CAR insurance is required and Clause 4 GCIP Declarations.  The facility was designed to cover projects which (i) commenced construction during the period of the Open Cover and (ii) were declared to the underwriters during that period i.e in both cases no later than 30 June 2000.  It then covered those projects until their conclusion, notwithstanding that that might be long after the expiry of the Open Cover.\r   Thus, the Open Cover allowed BP, within these parameters, a complete discretion as to which construction projects should be insured and provided that BP obtained for such projects declared within the Open Cover, a fixed premium rate and fixed conditions.  In that way it did provide BP with considerable flexibility in that it avoided the need for individual underwriting decisions to be made in respect of each project.  That was very valuable but that was the limit of the intended flexibility.\r   In particular, the purpose of the Open Cover was not to allow BP to declare projects which had not reached the stage at which insurance was normally required and were represented to be required by the draft questionnaires.  Is purpose was not to allow BP to make declarations prematurely merely because the rates/terms under the Open Cover were likely to be more favourable than those obtainable elsewhere after the expiry of the Open Cover, when the need or requirement for insurance in relation to a particular project might arise.\r   Therefore, on its true construction, a declaration to the Open Cover would only give rise to a binding contract of insurance if the "project" the subject of the declaration actually commenced construction prior to the expiry of the Open Cover, the contract of insurance taking effect or attaching  on the date of commencement of construction, and if the declaration was made no later than 30 days after the commencement of construction.\r   Accordingly, the defendants are not liable in respect of any of the 4 sample projects \xc2\x96 not one commenced construction within the period of the Open Cover.\r    Alternatively, a declaration to the Open Cover would only give rise to a binding contract of insurance at the date of declaration if, at that date, the "project" to which it related :\r   (a)\teither had already actually commenced construction and the declaration was made no more than 30 days after the commencement of construction; or  (b)\twas bona fide estimated to commence construction prior to the expiry of the Open Cover. Accordingly, the declarations in respect of the 4 sample projects are invalid because:\r   (a)\tIt is common ground that none of Valhall, Nam Con Son and Nakika was estimated to commence construction within the period of the Open Cover at the date of declaration to any of the underwriters; (b)\tKing Field was not estimated to commence construction within the period of the Open Cover at the date of declaration to the defendant underwriters, in so far as it was declared to them. The need for declaration no later than 30 days after commencement If, and contrary to the underwriters\' primary case, on a true construction of clause 4 GCIP Declarations, a "project" is to be treated as having commenced at any stage earlier than the commencement of construction,  a declaration in respect of such a "project" was required to be declared, if to be insured, no later than 30 days after such commencement.\r   This invalidates each of the declarations in respect of the sample projects in that, on BP\'s case, each "commenced" outside this 30 day period.\r   The need for declarations to be made to each underwriter In order to make a contract of insurance with an underwriter subscribing to the Open Cover, a declaration was required to be made to such underwriter prior to the expiry of the Open Cover, the declaration to such underwriter being the means by which a contract of insurance would be made with him.\r   The leading underwriter endorsement did not provide for declarations to be made to the leading underwriters only or indeed even relate to the declaration process.\r   As to the 2 underwriters who subscribed the Open Cover via the London Cover, the terms of the London Cover did not alter the position that declarations were required to be made to them individually.\r   There clearly is no market practice (as alleged) to the effect that declarations to the leading underwriter prior to the expiry of the Open Cover would be somehow treated as if made to the following market.\r   Accordingly, BP was required prior to 30 June 2000 to declare projects if otherwise properly declarable to each underwriter in order to bind that underwriter.  This is not a "technical" point as alleged by BP - unless relying on the pre-conditions to cover is "technical"!  It is simply a reflection of the period of the validity of the cover.  If BP and its agents failed to make declarations in time to any particular underwriter, that is its (or Aon\'s) fault.  There is nothing "technical" in underwriters refusing declarations made out of time.  BP cannot claim the benefit of the Open Cover when it had expired, whether by one day, one week, or one year.\r   A declaration is required to be an unequivocal statement that a project is being declared and providing, as a minimum, an identification of the project, its nature and inception date.\r   It is for BP to prove that each project was declared properly to each underwriter. If BP seek to rely on the 29 June 2000 document as a "declaration", such reliance is misplaced.  That document was clearly not a declaration.  Those underwriters who saw it were not provided with it as a declaration to them-it was not an unequivocal statement of a declaration.  Moreover, it clearly was not intended as such, not being on the usual form and not containing the information essential for the purpose.\r   Therefore, in a large number of cases, in so far as declarations to the defendant underwriters were made, these were made outside the period of the Open Cover.  Accordingly, in such cases, the purported declarations do not evidence or contain the terms of any binding contracts of insurance.\r   Analysis and Conclusions The principles by which contractual documents are construed In I.C.S. Ltd v West Bromwich B.S.  [1998] 1 WLR 896  at 912 Lord Hoffmann summarized the principles by which contractual documents are construed as follows:\r   "I do not think that the fundamental change which has overtaken this branch of the law, particularly as a result of the speeches of Lord Wilberforce in Prenn v. Simmonds [1971] 1 W.L.R. 1381, 1384-1386 and Reardon Smith Line Ltd. v. Yngvar Hansen-Tangen [1976] 1 W.L.R. 989, is always sufficiently appreciated. The result has been, subject to one important exception, to assimilate the way in which such documents are interpreted by judges to the common sense principles by which any serious utterance would be interpreted in ordinary life. Almost all the old intellectual baggage of "legal" interpretation has been discarded. The principles may be summarised as follows:  (1)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Interpretation is the ascertainment of the meaning which the document would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract.  (2)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The background was famously referred to by Lord Wilberforce as the "matrix of fact," but this phrase is, if anything, an understated description of what the background may include. Subject to the requirement that it should have been reasonably available to the parties and to the exception to be mentioned next, it includes absolutely anything which would have affected the way in which the language of the document would have been understood by a reasonable man.  (3)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The law excludes from the admissible background the previous negotiations of the parties and their declarations of subjective intent. They are admissible only in an action for rectification. The law makes this distinction for reasons of practical policy and, in this respect only, legal interpretation differs from the way we would interpret utterances in ordinary life. The boundaries of this exception are in some respects unclear. But this is not the occasion on which to explore them.  (4)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The meaning which a document (or any other utterance) would convey to a reasonable man is not the same thing as the meaning of its words. The meaning of words is a matter of dictionaries and grammars; the meaning of the document is what the parties using those words against the relevant background would reasonably have been understood to mean. The background may not merely enable the reasonable man to choose between the possible meanings of words which are ambiguous but even (as occasionally happens in ordinary life) to conclude that the parties must, for whatever reason, have used the wrong words or syntax. (see Mannai Investments Co. Ltd. v. Eagle Star Life Assurance Co. Ltd.  [1997] 2 WLR 945 (5)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The "rule" that words should be given their "natural and ordinary meaning" reflects the common sense proposition that we do not easily accept that people have made linguistic mistakes, particularly in formal documents. On the other hand, if one would nevertheless conclude from the background that something must have gone wrong with the language, the law does not require judges to attribute to the parties an intention which they plainly could not have had. Lord Diplock made this point more vigorously when he said in The Antaios Compania Neviera S.A. v. Salen Rederierna A.B. 19851 A.C. 191, 201:  \xc2\xa0". . . if detailed semantic and syntactical analysis of words in a commercial contract is going to lead to a conclusion that flouts business commonsense, it must be made to yield to business commonsense."  " In Youell and Others v Bland Welch & Co Ltd and Others [1990] 2 Lloyd\'s Rep 423, Phillips J held that the slip was inadmissible as an aid to construction of the policy.  He said at pages 428\xc2\x969:-\r   "The drafting of the slip formed no part of the relevant matrix in this case.  That matrix was the background to the commercial adventure that formed the subject matter of the contract, not the mechanism by which the parties set about negotiating and reaching agreement.  ...the strict application of the parol evidence rule has a particular justification in a case such as the present.  An insurance slip customarily sets out a shorthand version of the contract of insurance, in terms which may be neither clear nor complete.  Where, as here, the slip provides for the formal wording to be agreed by the leading underwriter, the other subscribers to the risk anticipate and agree that the leading underwriter will, on their behalf, agree the final wording of the slip and that of the formal contract which is embodied in the policy give rise to the possibility that the natural meaning of the slip differs from that of the policy, the natural assumption is and should be that the wording of the policy has been designed the better to reflect the agreement between the parties.  To refer to the slip as an aid to the construction of the policy runs counter to one of the objects of replacing the slip with the policy." The Court of Appeal ([1992] 2 Lloyd\'s Rep 127) rejected the submission by the defendants that the Court was entitled to look at the slip in order to resolve any areas of doubt that arose on the wording of the policy.\r   Staughton LJ said at page 133 \xc2\x96 134:-\r   "It is now, in my view, somewhat old-fashioned to approach such a problem armed with the parol evidence rule, that evidence is not admissible to vary or contradict the words of a written contract.  The modern approach of the House of Lords is that, on the positive side, evidence should be admitted of the background to the contract, the surrounding circumstances, the matrix, the genesis and aim.  Almost every day in these courts there is a contest as to what comes within that description .  As Lord Wilberforce said in Reardon Smith Line Ltd  v  Hansen-Tangen [1976] 2 Lloyd\'s Rep 621 at page 624, col 2; [1976] 1 WLR 989 at page 995, the expression "surrounding circumstances" is imprecise.  But so to some extent is "matrix", if I may say so, although it is a picturesque metaphor.  It may well be that no greater precision is possible.  The notion is what the parties had in mind, and the Court is entitled to know, what was going on around them at the time when they were making the contract.  This applies to circumstances which were known to both parties. And to what each might reasonably have expected the other to know. The negative aspect of the modern doctrine is that evidence of negotiations is not admissible as an aid to interpretation, at all events unless they show an agreed meaning for the language used.  In Prenn  v  Simmonds [1971] 1 WLR 1381 at page 1384 Lord Wilberforce said "There were prolonged negotiations between solicitors, with exchanges of draft clauses, ultimately emerging in clause 2 of the agreement.  The reason for not admitting evidence of these exchanges is not a technical one or even mainly one of convenience, (though the attempt to admit it did greatly prolong the case and add to its expense).  It is simply that such evidence is unhelpful.  By the nature of things, where negotiations are difficult, the parties\' positions, within each passing letter, are changing and until the final agreement, though converging, still divergent.  It is only the final document which records a consensus.  If the previous documents use different expressions, how does construction of those expressions, itself a doubtful process, help on the construction of the contractual words?  If the same expressions are used, nothing is gained by looking back; indeed, something may be lost since the relevant surrounding circumstances may be different." It can be argued that an insurance slip is different from negotiations for the formation of a contract.  It contains a concluded agreement between the parties, albeit one which they may expect, and even agree, to replace by different wording in a formal contract.  The nature of the problem which then arises is clearly illustrated by the present case... ...somebody, for some reason, has transferred the term as to 48 months from Period to Interest.  But that is no help at all.  Even if one could confidently discern what the words meant in the slip \xc2\x96 which I do not think one can \xc2\x96 there would remain the possibility, and perhaps even a probability, that the parties wished to alter that meaning when they prepared and agreed the policy.  It is not argued that the leading underwriter had no authority to do so on behalf of the others.   I accordingly would hold that the slip, whether admissible or not, is of no assistance in this case." Beldam LJ said at page 141:-\r   "Although the slip initialled by underwriters the original agreement between the parties, if it contains words showing an intention that the terms will subsequently be incorporated into a policy form, when the policy has been issued it is the policy and not the slip which constitutes the contract or agreement between the parties.  Reinsurers who invited the learned Judge to have regard to the wording of the slip as an aid to the interpretation of the contract did not seek rectification.  The slip is clearly admissible in evidence for some purposes.  Section 89 of the Marine Insurance Act 1906 provides that reference may be made "as heretofor" to the slip or covering note in any legal proceeding.   \xc2\x85 If prior to the passing of the Marine Insurance Act 1906, the slip was not admissible to explain or in any way affect the construction of the policy, in my judgment it was not admissible for the purpose of affecting the construction of the policy in question in this case. If reinsurers had sought rectification because the policy omitted a term contained in the slip and intended to be incorporated into the subsequent policy, no doubt the Court would have looked at the slip as a document in which the parties had originally recorded their agreement.  But that is not the case here and in my judgment the slip was not admissible as an aid to the construction of the reinsurance contract." In New Hampshire Insurance Co v MGN Ltd [1997]  1 L.R.L.R. 24 at pages 53-54, Staughton LJ (giving the judgment of the Court) said this:-\r   "Secondly, it was submitted that, once a policy has been issued, its terms are conclusive evidence of the contract between the parties unless and until it is altered by the process of rectification.  That can happen by agreement of the parties or by order of a Court but not otherwise.  And there has been no application for rectification in this case. This doctrine is said to be supported by Youell  v  Bland Welch & Co Ltd (No. 1) [1990] 2 Lloyd\'s Rep 423 and Punjab National Bank  v  de Boinville [1992] 1 Lloyd\'s Rep 7.  But in our opinion those cases are concerned with the situation where a policy has been agreed to by the parties.  In those circumstances the policy will, at any rate in the ordinary way, be conclusive evidence of the contract unless and until it has been rectified; the slip cannot be used to add to, explain or contradict the meaning of the policy.  That is not this case.  Here the issue is whether the policy ever was agreed to.  The insurers cannot pre-empt the answer to that question by the unilateral act of issuing it.  That was the reasoning of Mr Justice Potter, and we agree with it." In HIH Casualty and General Insurance Ltd v New Hampshire Insurance Co and Others  [2001] 2 Lloyd\'s Rep 161 , Rix J after referring to Youell v Bland Welch, Punjab National Bank v de Boinville [1992] 1 Lloyd\'s Rep 7 (Hobhouse J), St Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co (UK) Ltd v McConnell Dowell Constructors Ltd [1993] 2 Lloyd\'s Rep 503 (Potter J) and New Hampshire Insurance Co v MGN Ltd, said at page 179:-\r   "In principle, it would seem to me that it is always admissible to look at a prior contract as part of the matrix or surrounding circumstances of a later contract. I do not see how the parol evidence rule can exclude prior contracts, as distinct from mere negotiations. The difficulty of course is that, where the later contract is intended to supersede the prior contract, it may in the generality of cases simply be useless to try to construe the later contract by reference to the earlier one. Ex hypothesi, the later contract replaces the earlier one and it is likely to be impossible to say that the parties have not wished to alter the terms of their earlier bargain. The earlier contract is unlikely therefore to be of much, if any, assistance. Where the later contract is identical, its construction can stand on its own feet, and in any event its construction should be undertaken primarily by reference to its own overall terms. Where the later contract differs from the earlier contract, prima facie the difference is a deliberate decision to depart from the earlier wording, which again provides no assistance. Therefore a cautious and sceptical approach to finding any assistance in the earlier contract seems to me to be a sound principle. What I doubt, however, is that such a principle can be elevated into a conclusive rule of law. \x0bWhere, however, it is not even common ground that the later contract is intended to supersede the earlier contract, I do not see how it can ever be permissible to exclude reference to the earlier contract. I do not see how the relationship of the two contracts can be decided without considering both of them. In essence there are, it seems to me, three possibilities. Either the later contract is intended to supersede the earlier, in which case the above principles apply. Or, the later contract is intended to live together with the earlier contract, to the extent that that is possible, but where that is not possible it may well be proper to regard the later contract as superseding the earlier. Or the later contract is intended to be incorporated into the earlier contract, in which case it is prima facie the second contract which may have to give way to the first in the event of inconsistency. I doubt that it is in any event possible to be dogmatic about these matters. \x0bIs the insurance context different? Is the case of a slip followed by a policy a special case? First, it may be said that where a slip is followed by a policy there will usually be an intention to supersede the slip by the policy. That was the situation which was common ground in Youell\'s case etc. Secondly, the considerations mentioned by Phillips J, such as the fact that slips customarily set out the contract in shorthand in a way that is neither clear nor complete, will in general promote and underline the inutility of seeking to find in the slip an aid to the construction of the policy. Beyond that, however, I am doubtful that it is at all helpful to go." In the present case:-\r   1.\tI apply the principles summarized by Lord Hoffmann in ICS Ltd v West Bromwich B.S., to the construction of the 57 pages of the policy (contained in the Binder/Global Construction Insurance Policy). 2.\tIt is common ground that the policy was intended to and did supersede the slip. 3.\tThe placing information was not incorporated into the policy (see MacGillivray on Insurance Law 10 th  edn p. 287). 4.\tThe policy was available to an extremely wide range of Insureds (see GCIP Declarations clause 1).  In commercial terms potential Insureds (other than BP) would expect to be able to, and would need to be able to, ascertain the meaning of the policy without reference to other materials. 5.\tI refer below to the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties at the time of the contract. For convenience I continue to refer to the policy (contained in the Binder/Global Construction Insurance Policy) as the Open Cover.\r   The legal  principles that govern the Open Cover The Open Cover was a standing offer whereby the defendants agreed to accept liability in respect of any declarations made within the terms of the cover  (Citadel Insurance Co v Atlantic Union Insurance Co SA [1982] 2 Lloyd\'s Rep 543 at 547, Kerr LJ).\r   The facultative/obligatory nature of the Open Cover imposed no restriction on the claimant\'s right to choose whether or not to declare a project (Phoenix General Insurance Co of Greece SA v Halvanon Insurance Co Ltd [1985] 2 Lloyd\'s Rep 599 at 612, Hobhouse J).\r   When a declaration was made by the claimant under the Open Cover within the terms of the cover, a contractually binding obligation was created (Citadel at page 548, Kerr LJ).  A declaration within the terms of the cover constituted an acceptance of the standing offer contained in the Open Cover.        \r   In the facultative/obligatory type of cover the making of the declaration attaches the risk to the cover.  If the risk declared is within the terms of the cover there is no need for any specific acceptance by the underwriter, but an underwriter is not bound until receipt of the declaration (The Beursgracht [2002] 1 Lloyd\'s Rep 574 at 579, Tuckey LJ).\r   A declaration serves to inform the underwriter of what risks have attached to the cover and enables him to calculate as necessary and collect the premium due (The Beursgracht at page 579, Tuckey LJ) (and serves other purposes identified by Mr Compton-Rickett \xc2\x96 see below).\r   Where numerous insurers subscribe a risk, there is in law a distinct contract between the insured and each insurer.  In the case of declarations under the Open Cover, each declaration to an underwriter within the terms of the cover created a distinct contract between the insured and the particular underwriter.  The GCIP provided under the heading "Security":-  \r   "SEVERAL LIABILITY NOTICE... The subscribing insurers\' obligations under contracts of insurance to which they subscribe are several and not joint and are limited solely to the extent of their individual subscriptions.  The subscribing insurers are not responsible for the subscription of any co-subscribing insurer who for any reason does not satisfy all or part of its obligations." The true construction of the policy I turn to consider the true construction of the policy.\r   At what stage of a project could declarations be made to the Open Cover? It was part of the background knowledge reasonably available to the parties that an offshore project (including an oil and gas project) will proceed through a number of stages which will include "engineering, design, manufacture, procurement, storage, prefabrication, fabrication, assembly, construction or repair, float-out, load-out, lifting, installation or reinstallation, hook-up, pipe laying, tie-in, start-up, commissioning, testing, trials, performance testing, existence, modification, drilling, completion and partial/initial operating phases and declared maintenance period" (see GCIP Declarations clause 5(6)).\r   Internal processes within oil companies and other commercial entities differ.  In 1998 the Amoco Common Process ("ACP") was a five-stage gated business process.  The ACP started with a clearly articulated business strategy.  A project team, led by a Project General Manager used the ACP to make sure a project was aligned with the business strategy.  Project teams were cross-functional.  They included, as appropriate, individuals from different business groups/business units, shared services, joint ventures, vendors and contractors.  The five stages of the ACP were Appraise, Select, Define, Execute and Operate.  Mr Siebenaler explained that engineering would take place during the first four phases and could extend into the fifth phase (Operate).  Design is linked to engineering.  Most design activity occurs in the Appraise, Select and Define stages.  Manufacture occurs in the Define and Execute stages.  Manufacturing at a factory can take place during the Define stage.  \r   It does not of course follow that BP\'s internal procedures were the same as Amoco\'s (prior to the merger).  Co-venturers (for example Shell) had different internal procedures.\r   The background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties also included the knowledge that one or more of a number of alternative contractual arrangements might be involved in a particular project.  Mr David Sharp in \'Offshore Oil and Gas Insurance\' 1994 at page 114 referred to the turnkey contract, the EPIC (Engineering, Procurement, Installation and Construction) contract, sub-contracts with specialists, and the appointment of a specialised Project Manager to manage the letting of all contracts on behalf of the operator.  This should not be taken as a comprehensive list of possible contractual arrangements.\r   A striking feature of the Open Cover is the width of its ambit.  I refer by way of example (but without limitation) to the following:-\r   (i)\tThe width of the definition of Principal Insured(s) (BP Amoco and/or all subsidiary, affiliated, associated and inter-related companies of every tier, their shareholders, directors, officers and employees and at the option of BP Amoco co-venturers, project managers, financiers declared each underlying declaration) in GCIP Declarations clause 1. (ii)\tThe width of the definition of Other Insured(s) (any other parties may be declared including but not limited to contractors, sub-contractors, architects, engineers and consultants, suppliers, agents, manufacturers, vendors, licensors, limited to the Principal Insured\'s obligations to assume the liability of or provide insurance as afforded by the policy to such parties) in GCIP Declarations clause 1. (iii)\tThe width of the definition of project eligibility (Automatic for all projects of whatsoever nature) in GCIP Declarations clause 3.   (iv)\tThe width of the phrase "all operations" in the GCIP Declarations Period of Insurance clause 5(3). (v)\tThe width of the places at which the "Insurance shall apply" (at all times including while at temporary sites, pre-fabrication sites, fabrication yards, Contractors and/or Sub-Contractors premises (and/or Manufacturers and/or Suppliers and/or Vendors premises if mutually agreed by the Insured and Underwriters and declared), construction sites and offshore sites) in the GCIP Declarations Period of Insurance clause 5(6). (vi)\tThe width of the stages/phases during which the insurance will be in force (the engineering, design, manufacture, procurement, storage, prefabrication, fabrication, assembly, construction or repair, float-out, load-out, lifting, installation or reinstallation, hook-up, pipe laying, tie-in, start-up, commissioning, testing, trials, performance testing, existence, modification, drilling, completion and partial/initial operating phases and declared maintenance period of the Insured Project or otherwise) in GCIP Declarations Period of Insurance clause 5(6). (vii)\tThe reference to any part(s) of the subject matter(s) of the insurance, in storage, ashore or afloat, loading, unloading and in transit, in GCIP Section 1 Part A clause 2(B). (viii)\tThe width of the Property Insured (property of every kind and description including the works infrastructure, auxiliary facilities and temporary works...all materials, components, parts, machinery, fixtures, spare pipe, equipment or any other property destined to become a part of the completed project, or used up or consumed in the completion of the project, complete with all plant, equipment, machinery, materials, outfit and all property associated therewith whether intended to form a permanent part of the works or not, including site preparatory work...) in GCIP Section 1 Part A clause 3(A). (ix)\tExtensions of coverage in GCIP Section 1 Part A clause 4 including (in sub-paragraph D) physical loss or damage to plans, blueprints, drawings, renderings, specifications or other contract documents and models. (x)\tThe width of the Faulty Design Clause 6 in GCIP Section 1 Part A. (xi)\tThe width of GCIP Section II Third Party Liability cover including (without limitation) the reference to the Insured\'s "operations" in (B) and the terms of the Principal Insured (and other Contractor\'s) Property and/or Personnel Clause. (xii)\tThe width of "Cargo" at page 3 of the Binder. The Open Cover should not be construed by reference to what are said to be typical terms of forms of Construction All Risks insurance (placed facultatively).  The Open Cover contained a standing offer in exceptionally wide terms and should be construed by reference to its particular terms.  The standing offer was unique and was plainly designed to give BP very considerable flexibility.  No doubt the defendants were concerned to attract such business in 1999 at the rates provided for.\r   Central to the defendants\' case is the submission that for the purposes of the risks to be insured under the Open Cover, the parties chose a trigger, "the commencement of construction".  The defendants rely on clause 4 of GCIP Declarations in support of their contention that the facility was designed to cover projects which (i) commenced construction during the period of the Open Cover and (ii) were declared to the underwriters during the period i.e. in both cases no later than 30 June 2000. The defendants\' case is that while clause 4 of GCIP Declarations afforded BP the additional benefit of a held covered provision for 30 days by way of protection, if for any reason BP failed to declare the commencement of the project (i.e. of construction) before it commenced, it had a 30 day window after commencement in which to make its declaration.   I do not accept these submissions.\r   What is declared is a \'project\'.  Project eligibility was automatic for all projects of whatsoever nature (GCIP Declarations clause 3).  Clause 5 of GCIP Declarations provided at paragraph (6) that the insurance will be in force during the "engineering, design, manufacture, procurement, storage, prefabrication, fabrication, assembly, construction or repair, float-out, load-out, lifting, installation or reinstallation, hook-up, pipe laying, tie-in, start-up, commissioning, testing, trials, performance testing, existence, modification, drilling, completion and partial/initial operating phases and declared maintenance period of the Insured Project".  These words would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties, all stages/phases of an offshore project (of whatsoever nature) from engineering/design to maintenance.  The parties would have appreciated that a project might well (but would not necessarily) proceed through the stages/phases in the order in which they were listed in clause 5(6).\r   It is to be noted that "Other Insured(s)" include architects and engineers who would be concerned in the earlier phases.\r   I have already pointed out that GCIP Section 1(A) insures plans, blueprints, drawings, renderings, specifications or other contract documents and models.  Plans etc could be insured at any time during the Period of Insurance (as defined in clause 5 GCIP Declarations) for the interest of BP, or for the interest of architects or engineers if declared as "Other Insured(s)" in accordance with GCIP Declarations clause 1.\r   GCIP Section II \xc2\x96 Third Party Liability insures liabilities arising from or occasioned either directly or indirectly by the Insured\'s operations in connection with the Insured Project or parts thereof, which may give rise to an insured liability during any of the stages/phases referred to in clause 5(6) of  GCIP Declarations.  Liabilities referred to in the Principal Insured (and other Contractor\'s) Property and/or Personnel Clause could arise during the engineering, design, manufacture, procurement, storage, prefabrication, fabrication, assembly etc stages/phases.\r   The background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties included the knowledge that offshore construction projects are highly complex.  In \'Offshore Oil and Gas Insurance\' Mr Sharp observed at page 135:-\r    "Period  For an operation as complex as an off-shore construction project it is impracticable to point to one moment in time when the underwriters\' risk commences.  The issue is overcome by agreeing a date when the policy will incept, which is usually at some time prior to the commencement of procurement of materials and allowing underwriters\' risk to attach in respect of each separate part or item when such items become at the risk of any insured party, whenever that may be subsequent to the date of inception." The specimen contract at page 421 of Mr Sharp\'s book provides "This Policy attaches from the date of letting the first contract or on XXX whichever is the earlier, and insures in respect of each part item or portion of the subject matters of this insurance which is at the risk of an Assured at inception or which becomes at risk of an Assured after inception...".\r   In the present case the inception date of the contract of insurance created by a declaration was "as declared" (clause 5(3) of GCIP Declarations).  Thus the inception date was a date selected by the Insured.  The policy did not require it to correspond to any particular stage of the Insured project.  Clause 5(3) provided that from inception (as declared) there would be insured "each part, item or portion of the subject matters of this insurance from the time of becoming at the risk of an Insured hereunder...".  The declared inception date could be at any date during the Period of Insurance defined by clause 5(6).  I have already emphasised the width of the terms of the standing offer contained in the Open Cover in other respects.  The provision as to declared inception is another example of the flexibility afforded to BP (and others) by the terms of the policy.  I stress the significance of clause 5(3).  From inception (as declared by BP) each part etc was insured from the time of becoming at risk of an Insured.  In an operation as complex as an offshore construction project numerous different parts, items or portions of the subject matters of the insurance would become insured from different times.\r   I turn to consider clause 4 of GCIP Declarations which I repeat for convenience:-\r   "4.\tAUTOMATIC ACQUISITION Erection All Risk, Related Delay in Start-Up and Third Party Liability  All projects shall automatically be held covered hereunder for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days from the commencement of said project.  Coverage beyond this initial period shall be extended only upon declaration of the project and payment of any premium due thereon from the commencement of said project. Cargo and Related Delay in Start-Up All applicable projects to be declared hereunder prior to attachment of coverage." In \'Offshore Oil and Gas Insurance\' at page 245, when considering platform insurance wordings, Mr Sharp wrote:-\r   "A further additional provision is known as the "Automatic Acquisition" clause which secures a holding covered agreement automatically on new assets acquired by the assured.  It is generally subject to a sub-limit and advice to insurers as soon as practicable with payment of a commensurate premium.  There have been several instances where assureds have had to invoke this clause, where for example a take-over bid conducted in the strictest secrecy is concluded very quickly, leaving little time and information available to negotiate with insurers." Clause 4 must be construed in the context of the policy as a whole.  Clause 4 was for the benefit of the Insured(s).  It conferred additional coverage on the Insured(s).  It operated as a fail safe provision to protect the Insured(s) in circumstances such as those described by Mr Sharp.  Clause 4 on its true construction did not provide that BP would be barred from declaring a project to the Open Cover after 30 days from the commencement of the project.  If it had been the intention to bar BP from declaring a project to the Open Cover after 30 days from the commencement of a project, very different language would have been required.\r   The defendants\' construction of the Automatic Acquisition clause does not sit easily with clause 5(3) which provides for inception (as declared).\r   Clause 4 refers to "the commencement of the said project" and not to the commencement of physical construction.  The stages/phases of the Insured Project are set in clause 5(6).\r   It should be noted that the automatically held covered provision only applies to Erection All Risk, Related Delay in Start-Up and Third Party Liability.  In the case of Cargo and Related Delay in Start-Up, all applicable projects had to be declared prior to attachment of coverage.  There was no fail safe provision in these cases.\r   The defendants\' contention that the Automatic Acquisitions clause identified a 30 day period after which declarations could not be made would, if correct, lead to a result that was impracticable and uncommercial.  I repeat Mr Sharp\'s observation:- \r   "Period  For an operation as complex as an off-shore construction project it is impracticable to point to one moment in time when the underwriters\' risk commences.  The issue is overcome by agreeing a date when the policy will incept, which is usually at some time prior to the commencement of procurement of materials and allowing underwriters\' risk to attach in respect of each separate part or item when such items become at the risk of any insured party, whenever that may be subsequent to the date of inception." In the case of the Open Cover inception was from a date declared by BP.  This was, as already pointed out, another example of the flexibility afforded to BP by the terms of the Open Cover.\r   As to the time of interest:-\r    "In marine insurance the insured must have an insurable interest at the time of the loss [Marine Insurance Act 1906 section 6(1)].  If so, it matters not that he had no interest at the time of contract or that since the time of the loss his interest has ceased.  This rule probably applies to other kinds of indemnity insurance, with two qualifications.  First, in all other kinds of insurance, at the time of making the contract of insurance the person making it must have had a reasonable expectation of acquiring an interest..." (Clarke \'The Law of Insurance Contracts\' paragraph 4-4).  The answer to the question - at what stage of a project could declarations be made to the Open Cover?, depends on the express terms of the policy and on basic principles of insurance law.  I would answer the question as follows:\r   (1)\tA declaration had to be made during the period of the Open Cover, i.e. in the case of offshore risks between 1 January 1999 and 30 June 2000 (GCIP Declarations clause 5(2)). (2)\tInsurance was available under the standing offer contained in the Open Cover in respect of projects of whatsoever nature.  There must therefore have been an identifiable project in existence at the time of the declaration i.e. a project which had reached one or more of the stages/phases listed in GCIP Declarations clause 5(6), including engineering, design, manufacture, procurement, storage, prefabrication, fabrication, assembly and construction. (3)\tAt the time of the declaration, the Insured(s) must have had an insurable interest at risk or must have had a reasonable expectation of acquiring such an interest. (4)\tThe declaration had to be made for an inception date, selected at the option of the claimant, within the period of the Open Cover. (5)\tThe insurance attached from inception (as declared) in respect of each part, item or portion of the subject matter of the insurance, from the time of becoming at the risk of the Insured(s) (GCIP Declarations clause 5(3)). I leave out of consideration any further limitations imposed by the general law to the effect that a declaration must be made before a known loss and related points, because such issues do not arise in the four sample transactions.\r   The form of declarations to be made under the Open Cover The Open Cover was a standing offer whereby the defendants agreed to accept liability in respect of any declarations made within the terms of the cover.  When a declaration was made by the claimant under the Open Cover within the terms of the cover to a particular defendant, a contractually binding obligation was created.  There was no need for any specific acceptance by the underwriter but (unless the claimant\'s arguments as to the effect of the Leading Underwriters clause and the effect of the endorsement to the London Cover scratched on 21 July 1998 are correct), no underwriter was bound until receipt of a declaration by 30 June 2000. \r   A declaration under the Open Cover had to contain certain minimum information including (i) the project being declared and (ii) the inception date (see the reference to "inception (as declared)" in GCIP Declarations clause 5 Period of Insurance (3)).  The Binder provided that the required information for declared projects was "completed declaration [and] completed rating worksheet".\r   The conclusion that a declaration had to contain certain minimum information was confirmed by Mr Coffey.  Mr Coffey said that a declaration had to have a certain amount of minimum information including the inception date (which he described as "very critical") and enough information about the risk to identify it.  When asked "So if what you state is, \'This is something I intend to declare\', that to you would not constitute a declaration?"  He answered "No...I would make a further enquiry to discover exactly what they mean by it, but of itself, no, I agree that it does not constitute a stand-alone declaration."\r   The timing of declarations to the following market The claimant accepts that a declaration had to be made within the period of the Open Cover (i.e. between 1.1.99 and 30.6.00), but says that as regards all the defendants, a declaration was made at the time it was made to the Leading  Underwriters (Swiss Re and AIG), irrespective of the time when it was received by the defendants.\r   The defendants say that in order to make a contract of insurance with an underwriter subscribing to the Open Cover, a declaration was required to be made to such underwriter prior to the expiry of the Open Cover on 30.6.00, the declaration to such underwriter being the means by which a contract of insurance would be made with him.\r   I repeat Endorsement number 4 for convenience:-\r   "Furthermore, it is understood and agreed that all Underwriters subscribing hereto will be subject to all terms, clauses, credits, allowances and wording as agreed by the Leading Underwriters (AIG, Swiss Re and Aegis Insurance Services) and it is agreed to follow automatically all additions and/or deletions and/or amendments and/or alterations of any description whatsoever therein, Underwriters hereon waiving advice hereunder and also to follow all claim settlements made by the Leading Underwriters of this policy (No. EL9801152) without exception. ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED" It is necessary to distinguish between:-\r   (1)\tchanges to the terms of the standing offer contained in the Open Cover; (2)\tdeclarations accepting the offer contained in the Open Cover, attaching the risk to the cover; and (3)\tsettlements. I emphasise the distinction between (1) and (2).  Any change to the terms of the standing offer was a matter for negotiation.  If the risk declared was within the terms of the cover, there was no need for any specific acceptance by the underwriter.  The Open Cover was a standing offer whereby the defendants agreed to accept liability in respect of any declarations made within the terms of the cover.  Whenever an individual declaration was made thereunder (accepting the standing offer), a contractually binding obligation was created between the Principal Insured(s) (and where applicable Other Insured(s)) and the defendants to whom it was declared.\r   The claimant says (a) that the expression "terms, clauses, credits, allowances and wording as agreed by the Leading Underwriters" is a compendious phrase for the policy and (b) that a declaration is an "addition" to the policy, and as such binding on the whole market when made to the leaders.  I do not accept that the word "addition" was intended to include declarations for the following reasons.  \r   The word "declaration" is a market term, with a meaning readily understood in the market.  The word "declarations" appears throughout the policy.  There are numerous examples.  The first page of the Binder has a heading "Individual declarations".  The third page of the GCIP is headed "Declarations".  The word "declarations" is used several times in the Period of Insurance clause (clause 5 of  GCIP Declarations) considered above.  The word "declarations" is used in Endorsement number 1, in Endorsement number 2 and the foot of the page containing Endorsement number 4.  Had it been the intention to include declarations within the terms of the Leading Underwriters clause, reference would have been made to "individual declarations hereunder".\r   The words "terms, clauses, credits, allowances and wording" refer to the terms etc of the policy (containing the standing offer) and the words "all additions and/or deletions and/or amendments and/or alterations of any description whatsoever therein" refer to all additions/deletions/amendments/alterations to the terms etc of the standing offer contained in the policy.  \r   I draw particular attention to the words "Underwriters hereon waiving advice hereunder".  It is understandable that underwriters should waive advice of changes to the terms etc of the Open Cover.  A declaration, however, informs the underwriter what risks have attached to the cover and enables him to calculate as necessary and collect the premium due, to monitor his position in relation to premium income limits, to deal with accounting and other issues and to provide information to reinsurers.  (See further Mr Compton-Rickett\'s evidence below).  If the claimant\'s construction is correct and the word "additions" should be read as including "declarations hereunder", this would lead to the extraordinary result (in commercial terms), that the following market had waived advice of declarations.\r   The Leading Underwriters clause is concerned with defining the leaders\' authority to bind the following market to policy terms etc (and settlements) which the leaders agree.  The Leading Underwriters clause was not concerned with declarations to the Open Cover.\r   Mr. Coffey agreed that there is no difficulty in practice for a broker to deliver declarations to the whole market.  He can send an e-mail or a fax to the whole market or he can go round the market and deliver the declaration at the relevant boxes/offices.  Mr Compton-Rickett said that there was no problem in practice in making declarations to all underwriters concerned prior to the end of the period specified in an Open Cover.  All it required was anticipation of the needs involved and ensuring that the declarations were made in a timely way.\r   There was no need for any specific acceptance by an underwriter of a declaration, but he was not bound until receipt of a declaration within the terms of the cover, and declarations could not be made after 30.6.00.\r   Ma rket Practice In an amendment to Voluntary Particulars served as recently as 11 December 2002 the claimant alleged in the alternative that "as a matter of market practice, delivery of the declaration to the Leading Underwriters (Swiss Re and AIG) on or before 30 June 2000 constituted a valid declaration to the following market, including the first to ninth defendants".\r   "If there is an invariable, certain and general usage or custom of any particular trade or place, the law will imply on the part of one who contracts or employs another to contract for him upon a matter to which such usage or custom has reference, a promise for the benefit of the other party in conformity with such usage or custom; provided there is no inconsistency between the usage and the terms of contract.  To be binding however, the usage must be notorious, certain and reasonable, and not contrary to law; and it must also be something more than a mere trade practice"  (Chitty on Contracts 28 th  edn 13-018).\r   The claimant has not pleaded and does not rely on any custom, but on alleged market practice.  Mr Sumption QC submitted that a market practice is not necessarily binding or invariable.  It is simply a method of doing things in a particular market which is so common as to form part of the factual background against which the parties contracted.  It is relevant in the present context because a declaration is a market procedure.  What a declaration is, how it is made and when it is made are all questions to be answered by examining what the market procedures are.  \r   I prefer the evidence of Mr Compton-Rickett to that of Mr Coffey and find that there was no market practice or market procedure as alleged by the claimant.  Mr Coffey was not able to point to any written reference to the alleged market practice in any market commentary, guide, training manual or elsewhere.  I refer to Mr Compton-Rickett\'s evidence which I found to be more convincing in material respects than Mr Coffey\'s evidence.  \r   Mr Compton-Rickett said that he fundamentally disagreed with Mr Coffey\'s contention that there exists any market practice whereby, in the absence of specific prior agreement of participating underwriters to be so bound (whether through a leading underwriter clause or otherwise), declarations made to and accepted by the leading underwriters are automatically binding on any other underwriter.\r   In his witness statement Mr Compton-Rickett said "I fundamentally disagree with Mr Coffey\'s assertion that there is a clear and invariable market practice that following underwriters would be committed to declarations made to the leading underwriters, so long as they received the declarations within a reasonable time thereafter.  In my experience, there exists no "market practice" in these terms.  Not only does such "invariable" market practice not exist, but I have never previously heard of such a suggestion.  Given that in this case risks would be declared to the Open Cover which would not be of a uniform nature, the obligation to make the declarations to all of the underwriters assumes even greater importance.  It is imperative that underwriters are informed about and are aware of the risks which they are being required to accept, whether this acceptance be obligatory or voluntary, for the reasons set out...below."\r   Mr Compton-Rickett explained that underwriters have pressing needs and obligations for accurate and complete records of their underwriting commitments.  They need a timely record of their line exposures and periods of coverage on individual risks, together with the relevant premium due.  Whilst these needs may differ in minor respects from underwriter to underwriter, all would need to have accurate details for their reinsurers, for proper accounting, and for the control of accumulation of risk.  In the case of Lloyd\'s underwriters there are strict requirements for the recording of these features and the authorities take an extremely serious view of those who fail to comply.  It would therefore be unacceptable for Lloyd\'s underwriters to countenance a situation where they were unable to control the proper recording of risk details in the case of individual declarations.\r   (For completeness I should record that I do not accept the answer given by Mr Compton-Rickett in cross-examination as to the legal position that follows when a declaration is made to the leading underwriters in time, but to the following market out of time.  In the case of declarations under the Open Cover each declaration to an underwriter within the terms of the cover, created a distinct contract between the insured and the particular underwriter.  But this reservation does not affect my overall assessment of Mr Compton-Rickett\'s evidence as set out above, which evidence was based on considerable experience in the market).\r   The Eighth and Ninth Defendants The eighth and ninth defendants\' agreement to participate in the Open Cover was effected through a broker\'s open cover, known as the Aon Energy Risks Cover (the "London Cover"). The London Cover was a permanent open contract commencing on 1 January 1998 pursuant to which the eighth and ninth defendants (each for a share of 5% of whole) agreed to accept participations of up to a maximum of 10% in respect of:\r   \'all Aon Natural Resources Worldwide Business .. upon which Aon Natural Resources (Houston) receive instructions to provide coverage following all terms and conditions of insurances/reinsurances in respect of such business (\'Main Placing\') attaching for periods as required, not exceeding 36 months, and which cover any or all of the operations of assureds involved in or connected with the Oil and/or Gas and/or Energy and/or Marine and/or Sulphur and/or Uranium and/or Mining and/or Extraction and/or Exploration Industries in all or any of their phases onshore and/or offshore including associated support and service industries.\' As the period of the Open Cover exceeded 12 months, the specific agreement of the eighth and ninth defendants to its declaration to the London Cover was required.  This was initially obtained on 8 and 9 September 1998 (at which time the declaration to the London Cover was numbered 64). It subsequently was re-numbered, and became declaration 111 to the London Cover. \r   The \'Conditions\' clause of the London Cover provides, inter alia:\r   \'Agree accept Declarations subject to all terms, clauses, conditions, wordings, policies, additions, deletions, agreements, amendments, extensions, alterations, additional and return premiums, warranties, survey provisions, individual profit commissions or other premium allowances, held covered arrangements and all other stipulations and provisions of \'Main Placing\' and furthermore to pay costs and expenses as \'Main Placing\' and to follow payments, settlements and decisions of Underwriters thereon in every respect. ... Premium hereon to be signed to Underwriters on Monthly Bordereau(x) (Paid & declared) All declarations to comply with War etc.  Exclusion/cancellation/ termination provisions (as applicable) in line with current Market Agreements.  Each declaration complying with the foregoing shall attach hereunder automatically subject only to advice to Underwriters hereon prior to attachment date or within 14 days thereof. Declarations to be retained in the offices of Aon Group Ltd.\'  The \'Main Placing\' means the placing of the remaining 90%. In the case of Declaration No. 111 to the London Cover, this was the Open Cover.\r   Under the express terms of the London Cover, the eighth and ninth defendants were therefore bound by "all terms, clauses, conditions, wordings, policies\' and \'all other stipulations and provisions of the \'Main Placing\' ".  \r   The terms of endorsement to the London Cover scratched by the eighth and ninth defendants on 21 July 1998, noted that:\r   \'For sake of good order, it is understood and agreed Underwriters hereon to be advised only of any additions, deletions, agreements, amendments, extensions, alterations to main placement(s) generating premium transaction(s).   All other terms clauses and conditions remaining unchanged\'. If (as I find) a declaration under the Open Cover had to be received by 30.6.00 by each underwriter (as opposed to the Leading Underwriters only), the question arises whether a different answer applies in the case of the eighth and ninth defendants by virtue of the terms of the London Cover?\r   Mr Sumption submitted as follows.  Under the terms of the London Cover, the eighth and ninth defendants had already agreed to be subject automatically to any \'additions\' and \'extensions\' to the Main Placing.  The effect of the endorsement scratched on 21 July 1998 is not "entirely clear", but it cannot have been intended simply to repeat what was already in the London Cover.  Its object must have been to incorporate declarations under the \'Main Placing\' into the contractual machinery for administering the London Cover.  This would mean that declarations to the Open Cover would fall to be retained at Aon\'s offices, and \'advised only\' to the eighth and ninth defendants, in the event that they generated premium.  That advice was effected by the same periodic bordereaux used to advise declarations to the London Cover.  The London Cover was not a contract to which BP was a party.  It was a contract between the eighth and ninth defendants and Aon, under which Aon was empowered as the agent of D8 and D9 to bind them to specified classes of insurance contract and to provide certain ancillary services in the administration of the cover and the business generated by it.  Aon accordingly had a dual function as both agent for D8 and D9 under the Open Cover and agent for BP Amoco.  So far as the eighth and ninth defendants are concerned, a declaration to Aon was a declaration to their agent.\r   I do not accept the claimant\'s submissions in relation to the London Cover. \r   It is necessary to distinguish (1) the position between BP and the eighth and ninth defendants and (2) the position between the eighth and ninth defendants and Aon.\r   As to (1), BP was not party to the contract between D8 and D9 and Aon.  D8 and D9 were in the same position as the other defendants in this case.  The eighth and ninth defendants were not bound unless they received a declaration within the terms of the cover by 30.6.00.\r   As to (2), the specific agreement of the eighth and ninth defendants to the declaration of the Open Cover to the London Cover was required for the reasons stated above.  Following agreement by D8 and D9 to the declaration of the Open Cover to the London Cover, the eighth and ninth defendants were in the same position as the other defendants in this case.  They were not bound under the Open Cover unless they received a declaration within the terms of the cover by 30 June 2000.  \r   It is common ground that the reference to "Declarations" in the \'Conditions\' clause of the London Cover was a reference to declarations under the London Cover (not under the Open Cover).  It follows that the words "Declarations to be retained in the offices of Aon Group Ltd" was a reference to declarations under the London Cover (including Declaration 111), not declarations under the Open Cover.  It also follows that the words "Each declaration complying with the foregoing shall attach hereunder automatically subject only to advice to Underwriters hereon prior to attachment date or within 14 days thereof" applied to declarations under the London Cover.\r   The endorsement to the London Cover scratched on 21 July 1998 in using the words "additions, deletions, agreements, amendments, extensions, alterations to main placement(s)" tracked the wording of the \'Conditions\' clause of the London Cover.  It is again necessary to distinguish between (i) the standing offer contained in the Open Cover whereby the defendants agreed to accept liability in respect of any declarations made within the terms of the cover and (ii) declarations made by the claimant under the Open Cover which bound the underwriters concerned upon receipt of a declaration prior to 30 June 2000.  The endorsement scratched on 21 July 1998 applied between Aon and D8 and D9, not between BP and D8 and D9.  It provided that the eighth and ninth defendants agreed to be advised only of additions etc to the main placement(s) (being insurances/reinsurances in respect of all Aon Natural Resources Worldwide Business upon which Aon Natural Resources (Houston) received instructions to provide coverage) generating premium transaction(s).  In the case of most insurances/reinsurances no question of a declaration attaching a risk to a cover would arise.  Changes to the terms of insurances/reinsurances generating premium transaction(s) would be advised in accordance with the endorsement.  In the case of the Open Cover the endorsement applied (as between Aon and D8 and D9) to changes to the terms of the standing offer contained in the Open Cover, not to declarations under the cover.  There is a marked distinction between changes to the wording of the standing offer contained in the Open Cover and declarations to underwriters under the cover.  The wording of the \'Conditions\' clause of the London Cover (and the endorsement of 21 July 1998) reflected (as one would expect) the distinction (that would readily be understood in the market) between "declarations" and "additions".  As with the Leading Underwriters clause, if the parties had intended to encompass "declarations" in the endorsement that word would have been used.\r   Under the \'Conditions\' clause of the London Cover, the underwriters concerned agreed to accept declarations subject to all terms etc and other stipulations and provisions of the Main Placing.  The specific agreement of D8 and D9 to the declaration of the Open Cover to the London Cover was however required.  By the endorsement D8 and D9 agreed with Aon (not BP) that they should "be advised" by Aon only of changes to the policy wording of a main placement generating premium.  \r   Aon was acting on behalf of BP in relation to declarations to the Open Cover.    Aon knew, or should have known, that declarations by BP under the London Cover had to be made to all defendants.\r   In case I am wrong as above, I would add that if the endorsement of 21 July 1998 was intended to include declarations under the Open Cover, the essential terms of the declarations (including for example the inception date) would still have to be advised to the eighth and ninth defendants by 30 June 2000.\r   For completeness I record that it was not until about November/December 2000 that Aon provided to D8 and D9 a file of documents containing declarations and accompanying information in respect of declarations 8 \xc2\x96 26.\r   Answers to the Preliminary Issues I answer preliminary issue 2(i) to (iii) as follows:-\r   (1)\tA declaration had to be made during the period of the Open Cover, i.e. in the case of offshore risks between 1 January 1999 and 30 June 2000 (GCIP Declarations clause 5(2)). (2)\tInsurance was available under the standing offer contained in the Open Cover in respect of projects of whatsoever nature.  There must therefore have been an identifiable project in existence at the time of the declaration i.e. a project which had reached one or more of the stages/phases listed in GCIP Declarations clause 5(6), including engineering, design, manufacture, procurement, storage, prefabrication, fabrication, assembly and construction. (3)\tAt the time of the declaration, the Insured(s) must have had an insurable interest at risk or must have had a reasonable expectation of acquiring such an interest. (4)\tThe declaration had to be made for an inception date, selected at the option of the claimant, within the period of the Open Cover. (5)\tThe insurance attached from inception (as declared) in respect of each part, item or portion of the subject matter of the insurance, from the time of becoming at the risk of the Insured(s) (GCIP Declarations clause 5(3)). I answer preliminary issue 2(iv) as follows:-\r   A declaration containing certain minimum information (including the inception date) had to be received by each defendant by 30.6.00.  I will refer to such a declaration as a "valid declaration". As to preliminary issue 3, I do not consider that the project commencement date is relevant in the context of the answers to issues 2(i) to (iii).\r   As to preliminary issue 4, the outline history of the 4 projects the subject of declarations 5, 12, 14 and 26 is set out in Schedule 1 hereto.  I am grateful to the legal teams for preparing a draft of Schedule 1.  Where I have used words such as "the claimant says..." this indicates a matter that is either disputed or not admitted by the defendants.\r   I find, applying the answer to issue 2 (i) to (iii), that the King Field project had reached the stage at which declarations could be made to the Open Cover.  For the reasons set out below I find that no valid declaration was received by any of the defendants by 30.6.00 in the case of the other 3 projects.\r   In my judgment, applying the answer to issue 2(i) to (iii), Valhall and Nam Con Son Midstream had reached the stage at which declarations could have been made to the Open Cover.  The position was marginal in the case of Na Kika.  I refer to the accounts of the progress of this project in the witness statements of Mr Siebenaler and Mr Luyties, which provide some support for the view that Na Kika had reached the necessary stage.  It is not, however, necessary to consider Na Kika further because there was not a valid declaration to any of the defendants (see below).  A statement that a project was "to be declared" (in the future) could not on any view constitute a valid declaration.\r   As to declaration 5 (King Field), I find that there was a valid declaration to the first, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh defendants.  I find that there was not a valid declaration to the second, third, eighth and ninth defendants.\r   D2 and D3 did not receive a purported declaration in any form until after 30.6.00.  The bordereau scratched by D8 on 6.6.00 and by D9 on 8.6.00 did not constitute a valid declaration because, for example, it did not contain an inception date relating to the King Project.  All other communications to the defendants D2, D3, D8 and D9 were made after 30.6.00.  These defendants were not shown the declaration and the work sheet until after 30.6.00.\r   As to declaration 12 (Valhall), I find that there was not a valid declaration to any of the defendants.  The list provided to D1, D6, D7 and D8 on 29.6.00 did not include, for example, an inception date for Valhall.  The defendants D1 to D9 were not shown the declaration and the work sheet until after 30.6.00.\r   As to declaration 14 (Nam Con Son Midstream), I find that there was not a valid declaration to any of the defendants.  The list provided to D1, D6, D7 and D8 on 29.6.00 did not include, for example, an inception date for Nam Con Son Midstream (nor did it include BPA Share).  The defendants D1 to D9 were not shown the declaration and the work sheet until after 30.6.00.\r   As to declaration 26 (Na Kika), (on the assumption that Na Kika had reached the necessary stage) I find that there was not a valid declaration to any of the defendants.  The list provided to D1, D6, D7 and D8 on 29.6.00 showed Na Kika as "to be declared" and did not include, for example, an inception date (nor did it include BPA Share).  A statement that a project was "to be declared" (in the future) could not on any view constitute a valid declaration.  The defendants D1 to D9 were not shown the declaration and the work sheet until after 30.6.00.\r   When cross-examined Mr Siebenaler said that there was a dispute (in I assume about June 2000) with Swiss Re and AIG as to certain declarations, which was resolved in the autumn of 2000, by BP agreeing to pay some additional premium and withdrawing some risks for some projects.  When asked "Was the fact that there was this dispute with Swiss Re and AIG the reason why declarations were not produced to other underwriters at that stage?", Mr Siebenaler said that he did not know the answer, but that Aon would know.  No witness was called from Aon.  The dispute with Swiss Re and AIG referred to by Mr Siebenaler may explain why Aon did not make valid declarations to the defendants by 30.6.00 in the case of declarations 12, 14 and 26 (and only did so to D1, D4, D5, D6 and D7 in the case of declaration 5).  But whatever the explanation, valid declarations to each of the defendants were required by 30.6.00 to create a contractually binding obligation with each of the defendants.\r   SCHEDULE  1  KING FIELD \xc2\x96 DECLARATION  Date:\t\tEvent:\t\t\t\t\t\t   02 July 96 \tPreferred Supplier Master Agreement between Amoco \t \t\tand Cameron.
