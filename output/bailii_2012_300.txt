b'Mr Justice Hamblen:   Introduction 1. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n This is an application by the Claimant (\xe2\x80\x9cASES\xe2\x80\x9d) under s.67 of the\r\nArbitration Act 1996 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe 1996 Act\xe2\x80\x9d) for an order setting aside the Partial\r\nFinal Award dated 24 July 2012 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe Award\xe2\x80\x9d) made by John Jarvis QC (\xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\narbitrator\xe2\x80\x9d) whereby the arbitrator decided he had jurisdiction to determine\r\nthe dispute between the parties. 2. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n ASES is,  inter alia , a marketing and industrial consultant. The\r\nDefendant (\xe2\x80\x9cDelkor\xe2\x80\x9d) is a company specialising in the design, manufacture and\r\nsupply of mineral processing and solid liquid/separation equipment.  3. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n The substantive dispute between the parties, which was purportedly\r\nreferred to arbitration by Delkor on 31 May 2012, arises out of the supply by\r\nDelkor to ASES of a belt-assisted boric acid filter, which was to be delivered\r\nto the end user client ETI-Maden (\xe2\x80\x9cETI\xe2\x80\x9d), an entity controlled by the Turkish\r\ngovernment, at ETI\xe2\x80\x99s Bandirma site in Turkey.  4. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n ASES took no part in the appointment of the arbitrator or in any part of\r\nthe arbitration up to and including the issue of the Award because it was\r\nchallenging the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction under s.72 of the 1996 Act and was\r\ntherefore required to maintain its non-participatory status.\xc2\xa0 This was made\r\nclear in letters to the arbitrator. 5. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n On 22 June 2012 the arbitrator was appointed following an application by\r\nDelkor to the court under s.18 of the 1996 Act.\xc2\xa0 On 3 July 2012 the arbitrator\r\nheld a directions hearing.\xc2\xa0 On 16 July 2012 ASES issued its application under\r\ns.72 of the 1996 Act.\xc2\xa0 On 20 July 2012 the arbitrator held a hearing to\r\ndetermine jurisdiction.\xc2\xa0 On 24 July 2012 he issued the Award.\xc2\xa0 On 26 July 2012\r\nthe arbitrator decided to proceed to a final hearing of the arbitration with a\r\nhearing set for 10-12 September 2012. 6. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Given that ASES\xe2\x80\x99s s.72 application had been listed to be heard on 18\r\nOctober 2012 this timetable put ASES in a difficult position.\xc2\xa0 It decided that\r\nin the light of the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s decision to continue the arbitration in the\r\nmeantime and the fixing of a final hearing of the arbitration on 10-12\r\nSeptember 2012 it had no real choice but to participate in the arbitration and\r\nto\xc2\xa0 challenge\xc2\xa0 the\xc2\xa0 Award under s.67. 7. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Accordingly on 21 August 2012 it issued a s.67 application and on the\r\nsame day filed a Defence in the arbitration under protest as to jurisdiction. 8. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n \xc2\xa0There was then a directions hearing on 28 August 2012 and, in the light\r\nof ASES\xe2\x80\x99s participation and difficulties with witnesses and counsel in respect\r\nof a hearing on 10-12 September 2012, the hearing of the arbitration was moved\r\nto 21-28 November 2012 in Istanbul.  9. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n At a further arbitration directions hearing on 25 September 2012, the\r\nissues in the arbitration were separated and a hearing scheduled for November\r\nconfined to issues of contract formation and applicable terms, with a further\r\nhearing to be scheduled to decide issues of breach and quantum. 10. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n The arbitrator held that he had jurisdiction on the basis that there is\r\na valid arbitration agreement governed by English Law by virtue of clause 15 of\r\nDelkor\xe2\x80\x99s Standard Conditions. This provides that:  \xe2\x80\x9cThe terms and\r\nconditions of this proposal shall in all respects be construed and operated as\r\na British contract and in accordance with English Law. If at any time any\r\nquestion, dispute, or difference whatsoever shall arise between the Seller and\r\nthe Buyer in relation to, or in connection with the Goods, then every such\r\ncase, dispute or difference whatsoever shall be submitted to arbitration in\r\nterms of the Arbitration Acts 1950-1979.\xe2\x80\x9d 11. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n \xc2\xa0ASES\xe2\x80\x99s basis for this application is essentially that this arbitration\r\nclause was not incorporated into the contract between the parties, or was\r\ninapplicable, as the governing agreement was in fact a Limited Manufacturing\r\nLicence (\xe2\x80\x9cLML\xe2\x80\x9d) which was subject to Swiss Law and   which provides for\r\narbitration in Switzerland.\xc2\xa0 ASES contends that the arbitrator wrongly\r\nconcluded that the LML was irrelevant and/or inapplicable and that he further\r\nwrongly concluded that an Agency Agreement was relevant and gave effect to\r\nother documentation \xe2\x80\x93 specifically the document \xe2\x80\x9c471 ASES-Bandirma contract\r\n(draft).docx\xe2\x80\x9d - which had not been seen still less accepted by ASES at the material\r\ntime.  12. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n In the light of ASES\xe2\x80\x99 non-participation in the arbitration the\r\narbitrator only had a limited amount of documentary and witness evidence before\r\nhim.\xc2\xa0 For the purpose of the s.67 application, I have been provided with\r\nextensive documentation, witness statements, witness evidence and expert\r\nevidence.\xc2\xa0 The hearing of the application took four days.  \xc2\xa0 The\r\nIssues 13. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n The principal issues which arise are: (1) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  Whether\r\nASES is entitled to bring the s 67 application or may only do so on limited\r\ngrounds. (2) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  Whether\r\nthe governing arbitration clause is the Swiss arbitration clause in the LML or\r\nthe English arbitration clause in Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s Standard Conditions. \xc2\xa0 (1) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  Whether ASES is\r\nentitled to bring the s 67 application or may only do so on limited grounds. 14. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Delkor contends that ASES is not entitled to bring its s.67 application\r\nbecause: (1)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It has not exhausted any available arbitral\r\nprocess of appeal or review or recourse under s.57 of the 1996 Act; and/or (2) \xc2\xa0 It has brought a counterclaim in the\r\narbitration and thereby accepted jurisdiction. 15. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n S.70(2) of the 1996 Act provides that: \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9can application or appeal may not be brought if the\r\napplicant or appellant has not first exhausted:  (a)   Any available\r\narbitral process of appeal or review, and (b) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  Any\r\navailable recourse under section 57 (correction of award or additional award)\xe2\x80\x9d 16. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n S. 82(1) of the 1996 Act defines \xe2\x80\x9cavailable arbitral process\xe2\x80\x9d as\r\nincluding: \xe2\x80\x9cany process of appeal to or\r\nreview by an arbitral or other institution or person vested by the parties with\r\npowers in relation to that matter\xe2\x80\x9d. 17. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n S.57(3) of the 1996 Act provides that: "(3) The tribunal may on its\r\nown initiative or on the application of a party\xe2\x80\x94  \r\n(a) correct an award so as to remove any clerical mistake or error arising from\r\nan accidental slip or omission [emphasis added] or clarify or remove any\r\nambiguity in the award\xe2\x80\x9d  18. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Delkor submits that s.57 provided an available process of review to\r\nASES, whereby the arbitrator could address ASES\xe2\x80\x99s case that Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s Standard\r\nConditions had not been incorporated or were otherwise inapplicable.\xc2\xa0 It\r\nstressed that under the 1996 Act the arbitral process should wherever possible\r\ncorrect itself and that ASES should first have made use of that available\r\nprocess. 19. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n I agree, however, with ASES that there were no arbitral processes of\r\nreview or appeal agreed between the parties which were available to ASES\r\nfollowing the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s Award. There is no provision for any such process in\r\nany of the contractual documents on either party\xe2\x80\x99s case, and none has been\r\nagreed at any point following the conclusion of the contract or the arising of\r\nthe substantive dispute. S.70 (2) (a) of the 1996 Act does not therefore\r\nprevent ASES from bringing this application under s.67 of the 1996 Act. If, as\r\nASES submits, no such process is available, then  ex hypothesi  there is\r\nnothing to exhaust. 20. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n As to s.70 (2) (b), s.57 (3) (a) gives a tribunal the power, on its own\r\ninitiative or on the application of a party, to correct an award \xe2\x80\x9cso as to\r\nremove any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or\r\nomission or clarify or remove any ambiguity in the award\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 The mistake must\r\nhave arisen as a result of an accidental slip or omission; the slip rule cannot\r\nbe used by the tribunal to reconsider the award \xe2\x80\x93  Sutherland & Co v\r\nHannevig Brothers Ltd  [1921] 1 KB 336, CA.\xc2\xa0 As stated by HHJ Havelock-Allan\r\nQC in  Al Hadha Trading Co v Tradigrain SA  [2002] 2 Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s Rep 512:  \xe2\x80\x9cBy no stretch of\r\nthe imagination does the power in s 57(3) (a) to \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect an award so as to\r\nremove any clerical mistake or error arising from an accidental slip or\r\nomission to clarify or remove an ambiguity in the award\xe2\x80\x9d entitle a tribunal to\r\nreconsider its conclusion about the submissions of a party, especially where\r\nthose submissions have been safely received and accurately recorded in the\r\naward. I would endorse the commentary on s 57(3) (a) and (b) in Mustill &\r\nBoyd on Commercial Arbitration (2nd Ed, Companion Volume 2001 at p 341) where\r\nit says:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Neither of these powers is intended to enable the arbitrator to\r\nchange his mind on any matter which has been decided by the award, and attempts\r\nto use the section for this purpose should be firmly resisted. \xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa0 21. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Whilst the decision\xe2\x80\x9d in  Craske v Norfolk CC  [1991] JPL 760\r\nindicates that the power of the arbitrator under the slip rule contained in\r\nwhat is now s.57 of the 1996 Act (formerly s.17 of the Arbitration Act 1950) to\r\ncorrect errors in the award applies to errors which were attributable to the\r\nparties, as well as errors attributable to the tribunal, it also makes it clear\r\nthat it does not extend to oversights or errors in production of evidence or\r\nargument before the Arbitrator \xe2\x80\x93 see  White Book 2012, Vol. 2, Note 2E-226 at\r\npage 648. \xc2\xa0 S.57 does not apply to second thoughts, still less to second\r\nthoughts based on fresh evidence. 22. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n It is ASES\xe2\x80\x99s case that the arbitrator came to the wrong decision on his\r\njurisdiction based upon,  inter alia ,   an incomplete and incorrect\r\naccount of the events and the documents relevant to contract formation. The\r\narbitrator has not \xe2\x80\x9comitted\xe2\x80\x9d anything from his award; the award is simply based\r\non Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s version of events, since ASES was then, as it was entitled to,\r\nexercising its rights under s.72 and which required its non-participation in\r\nthe proceedings.\xc2\xa0 There was no accidental omission.\xc2\xa0  23. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n In the Award, the arbitrator has written what he intended to write, has\r\nnot included any additional words or omitted any necessary words, and there is\r\nno clerical error or ambiguity.  24. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n For all these reasons I reject Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s case on s.57.\xc2\xa0 There was no\r\nclerical mistake; there was no error arising from accidental slip or omission;\r\nthere is no ambiguity.\xc2\xa0 There was no room on the facts of this case for an\r\napplication by ASES to the arbitrator under s.57. This being so, there was no\r\navailable recourse to ASES under s.57 and s.70 (2) (b) does not present a\r\nbarrier to ASES\xe2\x80\x99s application under s.67. 25. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n As to the bringing of a counterclaim, this is only brought in order to\r\nsupport ASES\xe2\x80\x99s asserted right of set-off, which is a defence to a claim. What\r\nASES seeks to set-off in the arbitration are sums which arise from the same\r\ndispute as the arbitrator has decided that he has jurisdiction to hear (and\r\nwhich ASES in the same pleading makes clear that it still disputes). To the\r\nextent that the counterclaim is relied upon only as a set-off it does not seek\r\nto invoke the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction any more than any other defence.\xc2\xa0  26. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n ASES is not seeking to recover anything on the pleaded counterclaim. The\r\nvalue of ASES\xe2\x80\x99s counterclaim exceeds Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s potential claim only because ASES\r\ncannot be sure which parts will find favour with the arbitrator; that is hardly\r\nthe same as asking him to award any surplus to ASES.\xc2\xa0 This is made clear by the\r\nfact that there is no prayer in ASES\xe2\x80\x99s arbitral pleading, and ASES does not\r\nseek a monetary award but instead that the value of its counterclaim (including\r\napplicable interest) is deployed to exhaust the sums which may otherwise be\r\nfound due to Delkor. That is the purpose and effect of the table which appears\r\nat para. 76 of its pleading.\xc2\xa0 The counterclaim is relied upon for purely\r\ndefensive purposes.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As such, I accept ASES\xe2\x80\x99s case that by pleading and\r\nrelying upon a counterclaim to support a defence of set-off it has not\r\nsubmitted to the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction. 27. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Delkor further contends that ASES can only base its s.67 application on\r\ngrounds which were before the arbitrator. 28. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Delkor relies on s.73 of the 1996 Act which provides that: \xe2\x80\x9c73. \xe2\x80\x93 Loss\r\nof right to object. (1)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If a party to arbitral\r\nproceedings takes part, or continues to take part, in the proceedings without\r\nmaking, either forthwith or within such time as is allowed by the arbitration\r\nagreement or the tribunal or by any provision of this Part, any objection- (a) that the tribunal lack\r\nsubstantive jurisdiction, he may not raise that objection later, before the\r\ntribunal or the court, unless he shows that, at the time he took part or\r\ncontinued to take part in the proceedings, he did not know and could not with\r\nreasonable diligence have discovered the grounds for the objection.\xe2\x80\x9d 29. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n In  Primetrade v Ythan  [2006] 1 Lloyds 335, Aikens J, following\r\nColman J\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in  JSC Zestafoni v Ronly Holdings,  held that the\r\nterm \xe2\x80\x9cany objection\xe2\x80\x9d in s.73 (1) was intended to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany ground of\r\nobjection.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He stated as follows: \xe2\x80\x9c12. The point on\r\narbitration law arises because Primetrade now appeals the majority decision on\r\njurisdiction, exercising its right to do so under section 67(1) (a) and (b) of\r\nthe 1996 Act. It is agreed on all sides that an appeal on jurisdiction under section\r\n67(1) involves a re-hearing of the matter by the court, at which the parties\r\ncan adduce evidence and reargue entirely the issue of jurisdiction. But the\r\nOwners submit that Primetrade now wishes to run new arguments on the question\r\nof whether it was ever the lawful holder of the bills of lading and, if it was,\r\nwhether rights of suit were transferred to it. The Owners say that these are\r\nnew " objections"  to the jurisdiction of the arbitrators. The\r\nOwners say that Primetrade cannot raise new objections because of the terms of section\r\n73(1) of the 1996 Act.  So this raises the third important\r\nquestion: when there is an appeal under section 67 of the 1996 Act   from\r\nan arbitration tribunal\'s decision on substantive jurisdiction, to what extent\r\nis the appellant entitled to adduce new " objections"  to the\r\narbitrators\' substantive jurisdiction and to what extent is the appellant\r\nentitled to adduce new evidence on the appeal in support of either an existing\r\nor a "new" objection? I have dubbed this issue " the new\r\nobjection point". \xe2\x80\xa6. 50.\r\n[In  JSC Zestafoni G Nikoladze Ferroalloy Plant v Ronly Holdings\r\nLt d] Colman J began his discussion of this point by referring to remarks\r\nMoore\xe2\x80\x93Bick J (as he then was) made in Rustal Trading v Gill & Duffus SA.  Moore\xe2\x80\x93Bick J had described section 73(1) as being designed to\r\nensure that if a person believes he has grounds for objecting to the\r\nconstitution of the tribunal or the conduct of the proceedings, he raises those\r\nobjections as soon as he is aware of them or ought to be aware of them. It\r\nwould, he said, be unfair if he took part in an arbitration yet kept an objection\r\nto jurisdiction up his sleeve and only attempted to deploy it later.  51.\xc2\xa0 Colman J\r\nagreed with those observations. Then he said:  "I would go further. The\r\nprinciple of openness and fair dealing between the parties to an arbitration\r\ndemands not merely that if jurisdiction is to be challenged under s.67 the\r\nissue as to jurisdiction must normally have been raised at least on some\r\ngrounds before the arbitrator but that each ground of challenge to his\r\njurisdiction must previously have been raised before the arbitrator if it is to\r\nbe raised under a s.67 application challenging the award". He then referred to the\r\ndecision of Mr Field QC in  Athletic Union of Constantinople v National\r\nBasketball Association ,  and said that the concession of counsel was\r\n"clearly correct". Colman J continued:  "Were it otherwise, the\r\npolicy of the sub-section could be frustrated by introducing at the last minute\r\ngrounds of challenge not hitherto raised and thereby potential causes of delay\r\nand disruption of the application to the prejudice of the opposite party". 52.\xc2\xa0\r\nColman J went on to hold that if a party sought to raise a new point on a section\r\n67 appeal, it had the burden of showing good reason why the point was not\r\nraised before the arbitrator and it would usually have to do this by evidence,\r\ne.g. a statement. \xe2\x80\xa6.  59.\xc2\xa0\r\nIt is clear that the intention behind section 73 is to ensure that a party\r\nobjecting to jurisdiction, who has decided to take part in the arbitral\r\nproceedings, should bring forward his objections in those proceedings before\r\nthe arbitrators. He should not hold them in reserve for a challenge to\r\njurisdiction in the court. I agree with Colman J that this intention reflects a\r\nprinciple of "openness and fair dealing"  [2005] EWHC 2399 (Comm)   note76  between parties who may, or may not, be bound by an\r\narbitration clause. I also agree with Colman J, therefore, that to fulfil this\r\nintention and to accord with that principle, the words " any\r\nobjection"  and  "that objection"  in section 73 must\r\nmean " any ground of objection"  and " that ground of\r\nobjection". 30. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Delkor submits that ASES\xe2\x80\x99s application includes grounds based on\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cmistake\xe2\x80\x9d and that the arbitrator was \xe2\x80\x9cmisled\xe2\x80\x9d, that these were grounds which\r\nwere not before the arbitrator, and that these grounds of objection are\r\ntherefore new.\xc2\xa0 In such circumstances it is submitted that ASES needs to\r\nproduce convincing evidence to demonstrate that these grounds could not\r\nreasonably have been put before the arbitrator prior to his Award on\r\njurisdiction and there is no such evidence. 31. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n There is an air of unreality about a submission founded on what grounds\r\nwere put before the arbitrator in circumstances where the party in question was\r\nnot participating in the arbitration at the material time. \xc2\xa0Whilst it is\r\ncorrect that the arbitrator sought to identify and deal with such objections to\r\njurisdiction as were apparent to him from the correspondence, it was clear, as\r\nhe acknowledged, that ASES was not participating in the arbitration.\xc2\xa0 As he\r\nstated at paras. 3 and 28 of the Award: \xe2\x80\x9c3\xe2\x80\xa6..The\r\nemail (of 17 July 2012) was sent on the basis that ASES did not recognize my\r\njurisdiction to arbitrate this matter and that it had not participated and was\r\nnot then participating in the arbitration proceedings\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\xa6 28\xc2\xa0\r\nAlthough ASES has chosen not to appear or be represented in the arbitration, I\r\nhave sought to understand its objections to my jurisdiction as arbitrator in\r\nthis dispute\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d 32. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Whilst one can understand why the arbitrator chose to take this course,\r\nhe did so of his own motion and not as the result of any request or other step\r\ntaken by ASES.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  33. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n At all times up to the issue of the Award ASES was not taking part in\r\nthe arbitration proceedings.\xc2\xa0 In my judgment s.73 can accordingly have no\r\napplication in relation to what occurred up to that time.\xc2\xa0 ASES made no\r\nchallenge before the arbitrator on  any  grounds, so there can be no \xe2\x80\x9cnew\r\ngrounds\xe2\x80\x9d in its s 67 application in the sense of not having been raised before\r\nhim.\xc2\xa0 What the arbitrator took it upon himself to take into account cannot\r\naffect the matter. 34. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n As to what happened thereafter, when ASES decided it would have to\r\nparticipate in the arbitration, given the disparity between the arbitration\r\ntimetable and that for the hearing of its s.72 application, it immediately made\r\nclear that it was doing so without prejudice to its objection to the\r\narbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.\xc2\xa0 It then set out its detailed grounds of objection\r\nin its s.67 application and its Defence, both of which were issued on the same\r\nday, 21 August 2011.\xc2\xa0 In so far as those grounds of objection were further\r\ngrounds of objection and had to be raised \xe2\x80\x9cforthwith\xe2\x80\x9d I am satisfied, in all\r\nthe circumstances, that they were so raised.\xc2\xa0 Both the Defence and the s.67\r\napplications required careful preparation but were issued with due speed. 35. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n In any event the essential basis of ASES\xe2\x80\x99s objection to the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njurisdiction has always been the same, namely that the governing arbitration\r\nclause is the Swiss arbitration clause in the LML rather than the English\r\narbitration clause in Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s Standard Conditions.\xc2\xa0  36. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n In  Primetrade AG v Ytham Ltd  at [60] [61] Aikens J emphasised the\r\ndistinction between different grounds of objection and different or broader\r\narguments relating to existing grounds.\xc2\xa0  37. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n In the present case I do not consider that ASES is seeking to raise new\r\ngrounds of objection.\xc2\xa0 Whilst the evidence and argument relied upon has\r\nexpanded, ASES\xe2\x80\x99s underlying ground of objection has throughout been the same,\r\nnamely that it is the arbitration agreement in the LML which is the governing\r\nagreement.\xc2\xa0 In any event I would not therefore regard s.73 as precluding any of\r\nthe arguments relied upon by ASES on this application. 38. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n I accordingly dismiss all Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s procedural objections to the s.67\r\napplication.\xc2\xa0 It falls to be decided on its merits. (2) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  Whether the\r\ngoverning arbitration clause is the Swiss arbitration clause in the LML or the\r\nEnglish arbitration clause in Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s Standard Conditions. 39. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n There was an issue between the parties as to whether this falls to be\r\ndecided under Swiss law or English law.\xc2\xa0 This is closely bound up with the\r\nfactual findings I make in relation to contract formation.\xc2\xa0 I propose to\r\naddress the issue by (i) making factual findings in relation to contract\r\nformation; (ii) considering the position under English law on the basis of\r\nthose findings; and (iii) considering the position under Swiss law on the basis\r\nof those findings. 40. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n In relation to the factual issues, for ASES I heard evidence from Mr\r\nSaffet Baysal, the managing director of ASES, and Mr Richard Bond, the former\r\nmanaging director of Delkor.\xc2\xa0 Mr Bond was made redundant from Delkor in late\r\n2011 and was on gardening leave from mid August 2011.\xc2\xa0 For Delkor I heard\r\nevidence from Mr Terence Benkins, who was the relevant contracts and project\r\nmanager, and Mrs Sharon Benkins, who was operations manager and company\r\nsecretary. 41. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n In June 2012 Delkor obtained injunctive relief restraining ASES from\r\nmaking any calls under the performance guarantee and bond provided by Delkor on\r\nthe grounds that claims were being made by ASES supported by apparently false\r\ndocuments.\xc2\xa0 It is not necessary on this application to determine that dispute\r\nbetween the parties and it was made clear that there was further evidence\r\nrelevant to it which is not before the court.\xc2\xa0 However, I accept that the\r\nmaterial before the court supports the prima facie case of fraud which founded\r\nthe application for injunctive relief.\xc2\xa0 Delkor submitted that this seriously\r\nundermined the credibility of Mr Baysal and to an extent Mr Bond.\xc2\xa0 I accept\r\nthat it means approaching the evidence of Mr Baysal in particular with a degree\r\nof caution and that it highlights the importance of corroborating documents.\xc2\xa0\r\nHowever, the factual issues which arise on the present application have to\r\naddressed on all the evidence before the court. (i)\xc2\xa0 Contract\r\nformation 42. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Mr Baysal and Mr Bond of Delkor had had a long history of business\r\ndealings with each other covering a period of about 19 years.\xc2\xa0 Until March 2007\r\nthe business had been conducted with Delkor Limited but that company then went into\r\nliquidation.\xc2\xa0 Thereafter the business was conducted with the successor\r\nbusiness, Delkor (UK) Ltd.  43. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n ASES operated as an agent for Delkor Limited/Delkor which meant using\r\nits contacts and knowledge of the market and Delkor products to introduce the\r\ncompany to customers who might have an immediate or future use for the goods\r\nDelkor manufactured.\xc2\xa0 ASES\xe2\x80\x99s services were similar to those which would be\r\nperformed by a local customer service manager. 44. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Following Delkor Limited\xe2\x80\x99s liquidation an Agency Agreement dated 1 June\r\n2007 was entered into by ASES and Delkor, although it reflected an agreement\r\nwhich had been reached and operated from March 2007. 45. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Under the Agency Agreement ASES was appointed as Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s selling agent\r\nin the Turkish region.\xc2\xa0 Its provisions included an obligation on ASES that it\r\nwould \xe2\x80\x9cmake clear to all prospective customers that DELKOR concludes contracts\r\nfor the sale of The Products on DELKOR\xe2\x80\x99S standard conditions of business from\r\ntime to time in force\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d(clause 6.5) and not to \xe2\x80\x9cmake or give any promises,\r\nwarranties or guarantees or representations concerning the Products other than\r\nthose contained in DELKOR\xe2\x80\x99S standard conditions of business from time to time\r\nin force\xe2\x80\x9d (clause 6.10). 46. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Delkor relied upon this as showing knowledge by ASES of the fact and\r\ncontent of Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s Standard Conditions.\xc2\xa0 It also relied on a contract\r\nconcluded by ASES on Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s behalf in June 2011 with Soda Mersin which was\r\napparently on those Standard Conditions, and on the fact that during the course\r\nof the negotiations Delkor was copied in on the transmission of a Word version\r\nof the Standard Conditions.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 However, it was Mr Bond\xe2\x80\x99s unchallenged evidence\r\nthat despite overseeing hundreds of contracts over a period of 20 years there\r\nwere only a handful of occasions when Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s Standard Conditions in fact\r\napplied to the contracts made.\xc2\xa0  47. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n ETI is a Turkish publicly listed company and is the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading\r\nextractor and producer of boron products.\xc2\xa0 Delkor Limited had had dealings with\r\nETI but as a result of its liquidation was unable to complete a number of\r\ncontracts, including an order for a belt filter for Bandirma.\xc2\xa0 This led to\r\nDelkor Limited being blacklisted by the Turkish government, and it was\r\nconsidered that this was likely to apply equally to Delkor, as Delkor Limited\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuccessor business. 48. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n In the autumn of 2010 ETI put out a discussion document for possible\r\ntenders for a turnkey supply of a second filtration plant at Bandirma (\xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nproject\xe2\x80\x9d).\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In February 2011 ETI decided to activate an official tender and Mr\r\nBaysal and Mr Bond discussed collaborating in making a tender.\xc2\xa0 Collaboration\r\nwas necessary as ASES rather than Delkor would have to be the contracting party\r\nboth because of Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s potential blacklisting and also because it was\r\ninitially going to be a domestic tender which would only be open to Turkish\r\ncompanies.\xc2\xa0 Since ASES did not have the technical expertise to carry out the\r\nproject itself it would need to demonstrate that it had a committed technical\r\nsupplier for the bid \xe2\x80\x93 i.e. Delkor. 49. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n In the first few months of 2011 there were various discussions between\r\nMr Bond and Mr Baysal as to how this might be done.\xc2\xa0 In early April 2011 Mr\r\nBond received from Mr Baysal the initial tender documents for the project.\xc2\xa0 Mr\r\nBond was unable to go to Turkey at the time, so Mr Benkins, Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s project\r\nmanager, went out to discuss how the project might be delivered.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These\r\ndiscussions, with input from Mr Bond, resulted in three important documents\r\nbeing produced.\xc2\xa0 The first document was a Co-Operation Agreement headed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTechnical & Commercial Representation in Turkey\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cthe Co-Operation\r\nAgreement\xe2\x80\x9d).\xc2\xa0 This was so that ASES would be able to demonstrate to ETI Maden\r\nthat it had entered into a formal technical partnership with Delkor.\xc2\xa0 The\r\nsecond document was a draft tender submission (misdated 22 April 2009) which\r\nset out the process, scope of supply, commercial impact, estimated cost of\r\nsupply and a detailed supply list for Delkor to deliver the belt filter (\xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\nTender Advice\xe2\x80\x9d).\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The third was a cost calculation spreadsheet which set out\r\nin detail the suggested scope of supply, profit margins, costs and division of\r\nresponsibility in relation to the proposed offer (\xe2\x80\x9cthe PO Calculation\r\ndocument\xe2\x80\x9d).\xc2\xa0 As Mr Bond explained, the Tender Advice and the PO Calculation\r\ndocument would be changed regularly to reflect the parties\xe2\x80\x99 ongoing\r\ndiscussions. 50. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n On 24 May 2011 Mr Baysal informed Mr Bond that the tender had been\r\nannounced by ETI locally with a deadline for final submissions of 14 June\r\n2011.\xc2\xa0 The tender specification was provided in Turkish and was then gone\r\nthrough at length between them.\xc2\xa0  51. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n There was a discussion about formalising the terms of ASES and Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nco-operation and on 6 June 2011 Mr Bond sent Mr Baysal a draft agreement.\xc2\xa0 The\r\ndraft agreement stated that it shall \xe2\x80\x9cbe governed by English law, adjudicated\r\nin England, and arbitrated in England\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 Mr Baysal replied the same day setting\r\nout various points on the draft. 52. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Mr Baysal followed this up with an email the following day, 7 June 2011,\r\nwith the points which \xe2\x80\x9cI can not accept\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 These included the English\r\nlaw/arbitration clause which Mr Baysal required should be changed to refer to Switzerland or Germany.\xc2\xa0 He stated that: \xe2\x80\x9cArbitration and Law: Switzerland and/or Germany \xc2\xa0European Law , France, Germany or \xc2\xa0Swiss\xe2\x80\xa6 \xc2\xa0France is not different from UK \xe2\x80\xa6.endless courts\xe2\x80\xa6Of course, we do not expect but you never know\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d 53. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n On 9 June 2011 Mr Bond emailed Mr Baysal as follows:  \xe2\x80\x9cSaffet, Further to our discussions about the various ETI Maden Projects and our\r\nagreement in principle to cooperate with manufacturing licensed to ASES to\r\nallow DELKOR and ASES to penetrate this customers [sic] market and to reduce\r\ncompetitive efforts by other manufacturers. I enclose the form of agreement acceptable\r\nfor DELKOR for this. \xc2\xa0 I am continuing with preparation of the tender for ETI MADEN\r\nBand\xc4\xb1rma Filter 2 expansion; and enclose our last correspondence on this\r\nproject to identify the basis of this agreement and its intent. I also enclose\r\na copy of the cooperation agreement in place for this specific project. I\r\nconfirm that the ETI Bandirma second filter project is covered by this\r\nagreement. \xc2\xa0 I request you to sign the enclosed and, return a copy by mail \xe2\x80\x93 we will\r\naccept a Signed and certified PDF if you have this facility. However, I have\r\nalso couriered to you 2 off original documents for signature \xe2\x80\x93 you are required\r\nto return one copy by courier as well as any Email correspondence.\xe2\x80\x9d  54. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n The attached  \xe2\x80\x9c form of agreement acceptable for Delkor\xe2\x80\x9d of which\r\nASES\xe2\x80\x99s signature was sought was the amended LML already signed by Mr Bond.\xc2\xa0 It\r\nprovided at clause 3.f that the agreement \xe2\x80\x9cbe governed by Swiss law,\r\nadjudicated in Switzerland, and arbitrated in Swtizerland\xe2\x80\x9d. 55. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Although Mr Baysal did not sign the LML until July 2011, at which stage\r\nhe proposed changes to it, it was the unchallenged evidence of both Mr Bond and\r\nMr Baysal that he agreed to it at this time. 56. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n The enclosed  \xe2\x80\x9c co-operation agreement in place for this specific\r\nproject\xe2\x80\x9d was the Co-Operation Agreement. 57. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n The enclosed \xe2\x80\x9clast correspondence on this project to identify the basis\r\nof this agreement and its intent\xe2\x80\x9d   was the Tender Advice. 58. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Later on 9 June 2011 Mr Bond sent to Mr Baysal \xe2\x80\x9cthe technical summary\r\nbid for the Bandirma project\xe2\x80\x9d, adding that he would \xe2\x80\x9cfinalise a commercial\r\noffer etc. based on the documents provided to you in April.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The document was\r\na lengthy technical proposal running to some 70 pages.\xc2\xa0 It was headed with the\r\nnames of both ASES and Delkor, was addressed to ETI and was described as\r\nProposal Documents (\xe2\x80\x9cthe Proposal Document\xe2\x80\x9d).\xc2\xa0 Under Section 1.6 headed\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConditions of Contract\xe2\x80\x9d it stated that the offers was subject to Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nStandard Conditions as modified in accordance with ETI\xe2\x80\x99s Commercial Conditions\r\nand Technical Conditions.\xc2\xa0 Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s Standard Conditions were contained in Annex\r\n1 of the proposal. 59. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Mr Baysal complained about the length of the document, commenting that\r\nhe could not get it translated in the time available and that a detailed\r\nspecification was not required.\xc2\xa0 Mr Bond then sent him a shortened document of\r\n11 pages.\xc2\xa0 It was stated to be the bid to be sent to ETI, but with ASES to\r\nmodify to suit when translating. 60. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n ASES submitted its bid to ETI by the deadline of 14 June 2011 and on 14\r\nJuly 2011 learned that it had been awarded the contract.\xc2\xa0 Mr Benkins was then\r\nsent out to Turkey to source suppliers and to finalise the contract with ASES.\xc2\xa0\r\nHe went out to Turkey on 18 July 2011 and remained there until 29 July 2011. 61. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n On 19 July 2011 the LML was signed by Mr Baysal and the specific\r\nreference to the ETI Bandirma filter project as Item 1 in the Project Specific\r\nAgreement list was initialled by him.\xc2\xa0 At the same time he made two manuscript\r\namendments to the terms of the LML.\xc2\xa0 On the same day Mr Benkins and Mr Bond\r\nwere sent a draft Agreement by ASES (\xe2\x80\x9cthe ASES draft contract\xe2\x80\x9d).\xc2\xa0 This was\r\nbased on ASES\xe2\x80\x99s contract with ETI and its terms were not acceptable to Delkor. 62. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Delkor then set out about preparing their preferred contract terms.\xc2\xa0 To\r\nthis end Mr Benkins obtained a copy of the Soda Mersin contract which he then\r\nsought to adapt for the purpose of the contract with ASES.\xc2\xa0 The Soda Mersin\r\ncontract included a one page Contract Order document and then a five page\r\ndocument containing 12 terms, with other terms and conditions set out in listed\r\nAppendices. 63. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n On 28 July 2011 Mr Benkins had a meeting with Mr Baysal to seek to finalise\r\nthe contract.\xc2\xa0 Parts of the meeting involved Mr Bond by conference call and/or\r\nSkype. 64. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Early in the morning of 28 July 2011 Mr Benkins sent Mr Bond an email\r\nwith an attachment entitled \xe2\x80\x9c471 ASES-Bandirma Contract (Draft) docx.\xe2\x80\x9d asking\r\nhim to \xe2\x80\x9chave a look and answer where needed\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 Attached was a Contract Order\r\ndocument for the supply of a Delkor filter at a price of Euros 1,376,000.\xc2\xa0 It\r\nwas followed by an adapted version of the Soda Mersin contract terms document\r\nwith 7 listed Appendices relating to the Bandirma project.\xc2\xa0 At the bottom right\r\nhand corner of each page it was stated \xe2\x80\x9c471 ASES-Bandirma Contract (Draft)\r\ndocx.\xe2\x80\x9d  65. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n A little later Mr Benkins sent a further email to Mr Bond stating that\r\nMr Baysal\xe2\x80\x99s last offer \xe2\x80\x9ctake it or leave it\xe2\x80\x9d was Euros 1,300,000. 66. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n At 13.46 UK time (15.46 Turkish time) Mr Bond replied stating \xe2\x80\x9cThese are\r\nall the relevant documents in my opinion\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 The attached documents were the\r\nProposal Document; pro forma list prices; the Tender Advice; the Contract Order\r\ndocument; the \xe2\x80\x9c471 ASES-Bandirma Contract (Draft) docx.\xe2\x80\x9d with certain\r\namendments (\xe2\x80\x9cthe Delkor draft contract\xe2\x80\x9d) and the latest version of the PO\r\nCalculation Document.\xc2\xa0 The contract price was stated to be Euros 1,376,000.\xc2\xa0\r\nThe PO Calculation document had a detailed breakdown of the scope of supply and\r\nhow the price was calculated and showed a \xe2\x80\x9cback calculation position\xe2\x80\x9d price of\r\nEuros 1,300,000 without spares.\xc2\xa0 The Delkor draft contract stated in clause 10\r\nthat \xe2\x80\x9cIf there are contradictory paragraphs in the contract or the appendices,\r\nthe text of the contract has priority, afterwards Contract followed by Appendix\r\n1, 2, 3 etc.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Appendix 3 was Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s Standard Conditions and Appendix 6 was\r\nthe LML. 67. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n At 14.39 UK time (16.39 Turkish time) Mr Bond emailed to Mr Benkins and\r\nMr Baysal a \xe2\x80\x9cPO ADVICE doc\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 This was an amended version of the Contract Order\r\ndocument at a price of Euros 1,300,000.\xc2\xa0 That same afternoon Mr Bond sent to Mr\r\nBaysal, copied to Mr Benkins, the PO Calculation Document.  68. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Mr Baysal then signed the Contract Order document (\xe2\x80\x9cthe Contract\r\nOrder\xe2\x80\x9d).\xc2\xa0 There was a dispute as to whether other documents were signed at that\r\ntime which may have significance for other issues between the parties.\xc2\xa0 I am\r\nnot satisfied on the evidence presently before the court that any other\r\ndocument was signed on that occasion.\xc2\xa0  69. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n The circumstances in which the Contract Order was signed were in\r\ndispute. 70. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Mr Benkins\xe2\x80\x99 evidence in his first witness statement in the arbitration\r\nproceedings dated 17 September 2012 was: \xe2\x80\x9cThese are the documents that I\r\ntook to the meeting (i.e the attachments from the above two emails from Richard\r\nBond). The remaining appendices I also took to the meeting (the LML and the\r\nEnglish version of the ETI Technical specification which had been sent to me by\r\nBaris on the 26 ( see\xc2\xa0 paragraph 17 above). Saffet was given and saw all of\r\nthese documents at the meeting including Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s standard terms and\r\nconditions.\xe2\x80\x9d 71. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n This suggests that the attachments were physically taken by Mr Benkins\r\nto the meeting and were given to and seen by Mr Baysal in hard copy. 72. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n His evidence in his first witness statement in the s.67 proceedings\r\ndated 5 October 2012 was:  \xe2\x80\x9c..the Contract\r\nthat I had put together and used at that meeting with Saffet included all of\r\nthe documents sent by Richard in his email of 28 July, as well as the revised\r\nand corrected front sheet entitled \xe2\x80\x9cContract\xe2\x80\x9d (sent by Richard at 14.39). Saffet\r\nsigned the front page of the Contract in front of me. Prior to this I had\r\nhanded to Saffet on a memory stick each of the documents forming part of the Contract.\r\nThese included the documents that Richard had emailed to me.\xe2\x80\x9d 73. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Nothing was said in this statement as to the circumstances in which Mr\r\nBaysal was allegedly handed the memory stick. 74. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n The case put to Mr Baysal in cross examination was that Mr Benkins handed\r\nMr Baysal the memory stick and said \xe2\x80\x9cHere is the contract\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cThese are the\r\nterms upon which we will contract with you.\xe2\x80\x9d 75. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Mr Benkins\xe2\x80\x99 oral evidence was that he did not make the latter statement\r\non that occasion.\xc2\xa0 His evidence as to what he did say or would have said was\r\nsomewhat confused.\xc2\xa0 However, his evidence was to the effect that that Mr Baysal\r\nwas invited to and did go away and read the documents on the memory stick.\xc2\xa0\r\nThis was not put to Mr Baysal in cross examination. 76. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n It was Mr Benkins\xe2\x80\x99 oral evidence that all the documents provided on the\r\nmemory stick were agreed to by Mr Baysal and that he acknowledged this by\r\nsigning the Contract Order document. 77. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Mr Baysal said the only documents that he agreed to were those which he\r\nsigned and initialled (on every page), in accordance with his usual practice. 78. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n He denied being sent or presented with the Delkor draft contract or\r\nDelkor\xe2\x80\x99s Standard Conditions.\xc2\xa0 He denied being provided with a memory stick. 79. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n I am not satisfied that Mr Baysal was provided with a memory stick with\r\nthe attachments to Mr Bond\xe2\x80\x99s 28 July email.\xc2\xa0 If that had been done it would\r\nsurely have been referred to during the protracted discussions between the\r\nparties which ensued in September 2011 as to what the contract was, and in any\r\nevent at some stage prior to Mr Benkins\xe2\x80\x99 second witness statement in October\r\n2012.\xc2\xa0 Moreover, no explanation is given in that statement as to the\r\ncircumstances in which it was provided and what then happened, and differing\r\naccounts as to that have been given since. 80. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n I am also not satisfied that the attachments were agreed to by Mr Baysal\r\nin any other way.\xc2\xa0 The attachments were extensive.\xc2\xa0 Mr Benkins would have had\r\nto consider them before presenting them to Mr Baysal. \xc2\xa0Mr Baysal would then\r\nhave had to consider them in detail.\xc2\xa0 However, there was only about an hour\r\nbetween the sending through of the attachments and the Contract Order which was\r\nthen signed off.\xc2\xa0 Although Mr Benkins insisted that the attachments were the\r\ncontract, if they had been agreed one would expect them to have been printed\r\noff and signed, or at least emailed to Mr Baysal so that there was some record\r\nof the fact and terms of what had been agreed.\xc2\xa0 One would also expect the\r\nattachments to be amended to reflect the final price agreed, but that was not\r\ndone. \xc2\xa0Whilst it is possible that Mr Benkins showed Mr Baysal on his laptop the\r\nattachments which he had received, or some of them, they were not contractually\r\nagreed. 81. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n I find that the only document which was contractually agreed at the\r\nmeeting of 28 July 2011 was the Contract Order document signed by Mr Baysal at\r\nthat meeting.\xc2\xa0 I accept that initialling every page of any contractual document\r\nwas his practice, as borne out both then and later. 82. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n The reality is that only the essential terms of the contract were agreed\r\non 28 July 2011.\xc2\xa0 As both parties understood, the detailed terms, including\r\npayment terms, remained to be agreed.\xc2\xa0 Neither party was willing to sign up to\r\nthe other\xe2\x80\x99s draft contracts. 83. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n That the detailed terms of the contract remained to be agreed is borne\r\nout by subsequent events. 84. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n When Mr Benkins returned to the UK he handed Mrs Benkins two contractual\r\ndocuments to be put in the safe in a wallet.\xc2\xa0 These were the signed Contract\r\nOrder and the signed LML.\xc2\xa0 It did not include Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s draft contract. 85. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Delkor then prepared for an internal contract handover which involved\r\nsetting out the contractual arrangements.\xc2\xa0 The internal exchanges at this time\r\nrefer to the possible changes, additions and amendments, and make reference to\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe contract document so far\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cthe draft contract\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cupdated contract\r\ndocument\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 Further, the contents of the contract being discussed were not\r\nexactly the same as the attachments to Mr Bond\xe2\x80\x99s 28 July email that Mr Benkins\r\nsaid was the contract.\xc2\xa0 Those attachments were also in different terms to the\r\nhandover summary which involved, for example, different payment terms. 86. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n It would appear that Mr Benkins left matters to Mr Bond at this stage\r\nand that he expected him to put together the entire contract and then send it\r\nto Mr Baysal.\xc2\xa0 In the event this was not done. 87. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n On 5 September 2011 Mr Baysal emailed Mr Benkins stating that the\r\ncontract needed to be back to back with the ETI contract.\xc2\xa0 This elicited no\r\nresponse from Mr Benkins. 88. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n On 7 September 2011 Mr Baysal sent Mrs Benkins ASES\xe2\x80\x99s draft contract\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfor your review and advise\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 On 11 September 2011 he sent a further email to\r\nher stating that \xe2\x80\x9cSorry but we really need to sign the Purchase Agreement also\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nmaking reference to the ASES draft contract.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On 13 September 2011 Mrs Benkins\r\nreplied stating that \xe2\x80\x9cwith regards to the purchase contract I am working with\r\nTerry to get this clarified\xe2\x80\x9d. 89. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Mr Benkins was out in Turkey shortly thereafter and it was his oral\r\nevidence that he asked Mr Baysal whether he had received the completed contract\r\ndocument and was told that he had not. 90. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Later in September 2011 Mr Baysal asked Delkor to provide copies of the\r\ncontractual documents.\xc2\xa0 The response involved various different documents being\r\nprovided and demonstrates considerable confusion as to what the contractual\r\nposition was.\xc2\xa0 If there was a complete contract which had been agreed on 28\r\nJuly 2011 it should have been simple for Delkor to identify and provide it. 91. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n On 27 September 2011 Mr Benkins sent to Mr Baysal attachments described\r\nas \xe2\x80\x9cASES CONTRACT: Agreement\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 This consisted of the signed Contract Order and\r\nsigned LML.\xc2\xa0 Mr Benkins said in evidence that this was a mistake and that he\r\ndid not check the attachments before sending the email.\xc2\xa0 He said he had asked\r\nMrs Benkins to scan in the contract. 92. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n In his reply Mr Baysal said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Purchase Agreement: I have already\r\nsent you/Sharon the draft.\xc2\xa0 This should be signed immediately for payment\r\nrelease\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 Mr Benkins commented in his reply: \xe2\x80\x9csee the documentation RB sent\r\nthrough and the front sheet you signed\xe2\x80\x9d. 93. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Mr Bond, who was on gardening leave, was then contacted and asked to\r\nhelp sort out the situation.\xc2\xa0 He thought a \xe2\x80\x9ccompiled PO\xe2\x80\x9d had been \xe2\x80\x9ccreated\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwhich had been scanned and emailed to ASES.\xc2\xa0 In fact no definitive document had\r\nbeen \xe2\x80\x9ccreated\xe2\x80\x9d or sent to ASES. 94. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n On 29 September 2011 Mr Benkins sent to Mr Baysal what was described as\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cBandirma PO/Contract\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 The attached documents were not in fact the same\r\nas the 28 July email attachments which Mr Benkins said was the contract.\xc2\xa0\r\nIncluded among the attachments was Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s draft contract with \xe2\x80\x9c471\r\nASES-Bandirma Contract (Draft) docx.\xe2\x80\x9d at the bottom right of each page.\xc2\xa0 This\r\nwas the first time since the 28 July meeting that Delkor had sent to Mr Baysal\r\nwhat they contended to be the complete contract.\xc2\xa0 Mr Baysal immediately\r\nprotested that: \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry this is not what we agreed\xe2\x80\xa6it is simply f..n ASES\xe2\x80\x9d. 95. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n On 3 October 2011 Mr Benkins sent Mr Baysal \xe2\x80\x9cthe contract that you\r\nsigned, and was first sent to you on the 27 July which you read and signed the\r\ncover sheet\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 In fact no such documents had been sent to Mr Baysal on 27 or 28\r\nJuly 2011.\xc2\xa0 In so far as Mr Benkins was intending to refer to the documents Mr\r\nBond had sent to him, it is notable that he makes no reference in this or any\r\nother document to providing them to Mr Baysal on a memory stick.\xc2\xa0 The attached\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ccontract\xe2\x80\x9d still contained differences to the documents attached to the 28 July\r\nemail.\xc2\xa0  96. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n At this stage Mr Bond proposed that the parties resolve their\r\ndifferences by a single page contract in the following terms:  \xe2\x80\x9cBy this\r\nagreement between DELKOR and ASES we jointly confirm\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  1. Delkor shall commit to\r\nsupport ASES under the enclosed Licence Agreement for the ETI BOR Bandirma\r\nProject 2. ASES have Accepted, and DELKOR\r\nhave also accepted to comply with the ETI BOR Technical Specifications for the\r\nproject 3. ASES & DELKOR accept the\r\nPenalty clauses of the ETI Technical Specification, and DELKOR shall be\r\nresponsible for ensuring they are achieved, or comply with the compensation\r\nunder guarantee\xe2\x80\x99s and the terms of the Licence Agreement. 4. Payment\r\nand Terms shall be- a.  b. c. 5. Both parties shall make their\r\nbest endeavours to meet the combined intent of both parties in this project\xe2\x80\x9d 97. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n On 4 October 2011 Mrs Benkins sent ASES an email stating: \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe confirm\r\nthe following:- 1. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  \xe2\x80\x9cDelkor\r\nshall commit to support ASES under the enclosed Licence Agreement for the ETI\r\nBOR Bandirma Project. 2. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  ASES\r\nhave accepted, and Delkor have also accepted to comply with the ETI BOR\r\nTechnical specifications for the project. 3. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  ASES\r\nand Delkor accept the penalty clauses of the ETI Technical Specification and\r\nDelkor shall be responsible for ensuring they are achieved, or comply with the\r\ncompensation under guarantees and the terms of the Licence Agreement. 4. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  Payment\r\nterms will be 25% with APG( APG received by ASES) 50% at the delivery against APG\r\nand APG valid until the good acceptance of ETI. Released against shipping\r\ninformation documents. 25% after final\r\nacceptance by ETI 5. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  Delkor\r\nwill do everything in its power to get the goods to site before 31  December 2011, however at present\r\nwe know that the pumps will be late and we will do our utmost to improve this\xe2\x80\x9d 98. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n This was followed up by a signed \xe2\x80\x9cletter of support\xe2\x80\x9d in the same terms;\r\nthe Contract Order; a Purchase Order ASES-47111 signed by Mr Bond and Mr\r\nBaysal; and a signed copy of the LML with Mr Bond\xe2\x80\x99s initialled agreement to Mr\r\nBaysal\xe2\x80\x99s manuscript changes.\xc2\xa0 Shortly thereafter ASES made the first payment\r\nunder the contract. 99. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n I find that the essential terms of the contract were agreed on 28 July\r\n2011.\xc2\xa0 There was at that stage no agreement on the detailed terms of the\r\ncontract.\xc2\xa0 Thereafter there was no agreement as to the further terms of the\r\ncontract until 4 October 2011 when it was agreed to proceed on the basis of the\r\nterms set out in Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s 4 October email and the signed documents provided in\r\nrelation thereto. (ii) The\r\nposition under English law 100. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n The essential terms of the contract agreed on 28 July 2011 were as set\r\nout in the Contract Order, namely \xe2\x80\x9cSupply of one Delkor filter 40m2 and\r\nancillary equipment in accordance with Delkor offer\xe2\x80\x9d at the price and on the\r\ndelivery terms there stated. 101. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n It was Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s case that such terms included its Standard Conditions\r\nbecause of (1) the reference to and priority afforded to them in its draft\r\ncontract and/or (2) the reference to them in the Proposal Document which Delkor\r\ncontended was the \xe2\x80\x9cDelkor offer\xe2\x80\x9d referred to and/or (3) the reference to all\r\norders being subject to the Standard Conditions on the face of the Contract\r\nOrder. 102. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n As to (1), I have found that neither party\xe2\x80\x99s draft contracts were agreed\r\nto on 28 July 2011.\xc2\xa0 Further, the Contract Order (unlike previous and later\r\ndrafts) makes no reference to Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s draft contract. 103. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n As to (2), the essential purpose of the reference to the \xe2\x80\x9cDelkor offer\xe2\x80\x9d\r\nwas to identify the scope of supply covered by the order.\xc2\xa0 That was most\r\nclearly set out in the latest version of the PO Calculation Document which I\r\nfind to be the \xe2\x80\x9coffer\xe2\x80\x9d referred to.\xc2\xa0 This was the document which set out what\r\nwas being supplied, by whom and how the price was made up.\xc2\xa0 Moreover, it was\r\nseparately sent through to Mr Baysal and Mr Benkins that same afternoon.\xc2\xa0  104. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n It is unlikely to have been a reference to the Proposal Document.\xc2\xa0 That\r\nwas a document which was addressed to ETI not ASES.\xc2\xa0 It had never been accepted\r\nor used by ASES who had insisted on a short form document.\xc2\xa0 Although it was the\r\ntechnical document containing the most detail, as between ASES and Delkor there\r\nwas no need for such detail.\xc2\xa0 All that was needed was identification of the\r\nscope of supply, which the PO Calculation Document provided.\xc2\xa0 Further, even if it\r\nhad been a reference to the Delkor Proposal it would have been a reference to\r\nthe technical aspects of the Proposal rather than commercial terms.\xc2\xa0 Discussion\r\nand agreement on such terms was being held over. 105. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n As to (3), the Contract Order does refer on its face to Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nStandard Conditions.\xc2\xa0 However, as found, they were not provided with or\r\nattached to the Contract Order.\xc2\xa0 Although ASES would have been generally aware\r\nof the Standard Conditions from prior dealings this was not in the context of\r\ndirect contractual relations with Delkor.\xc2\xa0 It had never had cause to consider\r\nthem in that context.\xc2\xa0 Moreover, the deal agreed on 28 July 2011 was essential\r\nterms only.\xc2\xa0 Agreement on the detailed contractual provisions was to be held\r\nover, which would clearly include any applicable terms and conditions.\xc2\xa0 Yet\r\nfurther, it would never have made sense for Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s Standard Conditions to\r\napply  per se. \xc2\xa0 It was always recognised and intended that they would as\r\na minimum have to give way to ETI\xe2\x80\x99s technical and commercial terms, as\r\nreflected in the Proposal Document.\xc2\xa0 How they would apply, if at all, would\r\nneed to be discussed and agreed.\xc2\xa0  106. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Against the background of the nature of the agreement which I have found\r\nto be reached on 28 July 2011 I consider that the proper construction of the\r\nContract Order is that the parties were signing up to the typed provisions of\r\nthe Contract Order, not its boiler plate printed terms.\xc2\xa0 No-one was\r\ncontemplating, for example, that ASES was going to be sending an acknowledgment\r\nwithin 7 days or providing immediate notification of incorrect details, the\r\nother aspects of the printed terms.\xc2\xa0 I further find that incorporation of such\r\nterms would have been contrary to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 understanding and agreement to\r\nhold over discussion of and agreement on the detailed contract terms. 107. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Even it that be incorrect and the Standard Conditions were incorporated,\r\nfor reasons discussed below, the English arbitration clause would not be\r\nincorporated or would not be applicable. 108. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n In relation to the contract as finalised on 4 October 2011, by that time\r\nthe parties had clarified the scope of supply covered by \xe2\x80\x9cDelkor\xe2\x80\x99s offer\xe2\x80\x9d by\r\nsigning a scope of supply document, which was the PO Calculation Document\r\nwithout the figures.\xc2\xa0 Even if the Proposal Document had been the initial\r\n\xe2\x80\x9coffer\xe2\x80\x9d referred to, this was no longer the case after 4 October 2011. 109. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n The reference to the Standard Conditions remained on the Contract Order,\r\nbut the context now was that the detailed conditions had been agreed upon and\r\nthey were as set out in the signed 4 October 2011 documents, as summarised in\r\nthe Delkor confirmation email and letter of support.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That email/letter made\r\nno reference to the Standard Conditions.\xc2\xa0 Nor were the Standard Conditions\r\nsigned or included as one of the 4 October 2011 documents.\xc2\xa0 If, as found, they\r\nwere not agreed as part of the 28 July 2011 essential terms contract there was\r\nno further development or document which would show a subsequent intent to\r\nincorporate them \xe2\x80\x93 quite the contrary.\xc2\xa0  110. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Even if they were incorporated the English arbitration clause would not\r\nbe incorporated or would not be applicable by reason of the Swiss arbitration\r\nclause in the LML. 111. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n The LML provides that: \xe2\x80\x9cFORM OF\r\nAGREEMENT  LIMITED\r\nMANUFACTURING LICENCE  BETWEEN DELKOR\r\nAND ASES  \xc2\xa0 1. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  DELKOR\r\nand ASES willing and freely wish to enter into an agreement to co-operate in\r\nthe Limited Licensed manufacture of specific Delkor Equipment \xe2\x80\x93 specifically\r\nthe DELKOR Horizontal Belt Filter 2. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  The\r\npurpose of the agreement shall be to provide a market access route for DELKOR\r\nproducts and Services to ETI Maden while protecting DELKOR from ETI Maden and\r\ncommercial revenue form the majority of the tender contract value. 3. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  The\r\nAgreement shall be \xe2\x80\x93  a. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  this\r\ngeneral term of agreement plus attachment relating to

The\r\nresponsibilities under this agreement of the parties shall be defined as:- a. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  DELKOR\r\nshall provide to ASES the following items in exchange for receipt of funds as\r\nidentified by DELKOR in their offer to ASES:- \xe2\x80\xa6. iii. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Capital equipment and components as required by the DELKOR design to\r\ndeliver the projects sold by ASES. v.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To act as a procurement agent on behalf of ASES in\r\ncompletion of the project sold by ASES. \xe2\x80\xa6. \xc2\xa0 b. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n ASES shall provide \xe2\x80\xa6.. vi. Purchase those goods\r\nidentified by DELKOR, or variants agreed by DELKOR within the supply budget \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\xa6.. 7. Design ownership a.   The purpose of the agreement\r\nrequires utilisation of DELKOR \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0designs to manufacture and deliver\r\nequipment.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0 112. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n On its face the LML clearly applies to the Bandirma belt filter project\r\nand contract.\xc2\xa0 It is specifically referred to in clause 1. and is listed and\r\ninitialled in the \xe2\x80\x9cProject Specific Agreement List\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 Clause 3 provides that\r\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cAgreement shall be\xe2\x80\x9d not only \xe2\x80\x9cthe general term of agreement\xe2\x80\x9d but also the\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cattachments relating to specific projects identified and agreed by DELKOR\xe2\x80\x9d,\r\nwhich included the belt filter project.\xc2\xa0 The agreement relating to the belt\r\nfilter project was therefore contractually agreed to be part of the LML. 113. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n The relevance and applicability of the LML is further confirmed by the\r\nparties\xe2\x80\x99 dealings.\xc2\xa0 It was agreed to in early June 2011.\xc2\xa0 Mr Baysal signed it\r\non 19 July 2011.\xc2\xa0 Both parties re-signed it in the context of the 4 October\r\n2011 agreement.\xc2\xa0  114. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n It is further confirmed by the terms of the 4 October 2011 agreement.\xc2\xa0\r\nThat agreement involved confirmation that Delkor was supporting ASES in\r\nrelation to the project \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d the LML.\xc2\xa0 It was one of the 4 October 2011\r\nsigned documents which were intended to set out the contract terms, being\r\ndescribed by Delkor as \xe2\x80\x9cform of agreement\xe2\x80\x9d. 115. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Delkor contended that notwithstanding the LML\xe2\x80\x99s terms and the 4 October\r\n2011 agreement, the LML was inapplicable to the project contract because that\r\nwas ultimately a contract of supply rather than of licensed manufacture.\xc2\xa0\r\nHowever, it is apparent from its terms that the LML was not simply concerned\r\nwith licensed manufacture.\xc2\xa0 The purpose of the agreement was, as expressly set\r\nout in clause 2, \xe2\x80\x9cto provide market access route for DELKOR products and\r\nServices while protecting DELKOR from ETI Maden terms and conditions\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 That\r\nbroad purpose could be achieved in various ways which might or might not\r\ninvolve licensed manufacture.\xc2\xa0  116. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n The responsibilities of the parties as set out in clauses 5 and 6 are\r\nwidely drawn and in fact do not include any manufacturing responsibility on\r\nASES\xe2\x80\x99s part.\xc2\xa0 Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s listed responsibilities include supply of \xe2\x80\x9cCapital\r\nequipment and components as required by the DELKOR design to deliver the\r\nprojects sold by ASES\xe2\x80\x9d and those of ASES include purchase of Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s goods.\xc2\xa0  117. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n It was, as Mr Bond explained, a flexible agreement that was meant to\r\ncover various different means by which Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s products and services might be\r\nprovided to ETI through ASES.\xc2\xa0 Licensed manufacture by ASES or others was\r\nallowed for but it was not the sole purpose of the agreement.\xc2\xa0  118. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Quite apart from the specific application of the LML to the project, as\r\nset out in the LML and confirmed in the 4 October 2011 agreement, there is no\r\ndifficulty about its terms being applicable to the project and the project\r\ncontract.\xc2\xa0 If it be the case that there was to be no licensed manufacturing in\r\nTurkey under the contract as finally agreed then clause 7 of the LML would not\r\nbe relevant to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dealings, but most of the other provisions of the\r\nLML would be.\xc2\xa0 The LML was and remained the framework agreement under which the\r\nproject contract was made. 119. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n As a framework agreement of general applicability to project contracts,\r\nincluding, specifically, the belt filter project and contract, a generally\r\nworded arbitration clause such as clause 3.f would as a matter of English law\r\nbe applicable to disputes arising under that specific project contract.\xc2\xa0 This\r\nis borne out by clause 3.a which confirms the applicability of the LML to such\r\ncontracts.\xc2\xa0 It would, of course, be possible for the parties to contract\r\notherwise in relation to a particular project, but the intention to derogate\r\nfrom the specifically agreed Swiss law/arbitration regime generally applicable\r\nwould need to be made clear. 120. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Even if the Standard Conditions were incorporated into the contract I\r\nconsider that as a matter of English law the specifically agreed Swiss\r\narbitration clause would prevail over the English arbitration clause\r\nincorporated, if at all, by general reference.\xc2\xa0 There would in those\r\ncircumstances be a clear conflict between the two provisions.\xc2\xa0 There is a\r\nstrong presumption in favour of one stop adjudication in construing arbitration\r\nclauses.\xc2\xa0 The courts recognise the commercial implausibility of agreeing to\r\ndetermine related disputes by entirely different means.\xc2\xa0 In this case: a\r\ndifferent law; a different country; a different arbitration procedure and one\r\nvenue which is neutral and another which is not. This conclusion is reinforced\r\nby the 4 October 2011 agreement which clearly affirms the applicability of the\r\nLML to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 contract.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I accordingly reject Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s fallback case\r\nthat the two agreements were intended to and did co-exist. (iii) the position under Swiss law 121. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n In so far as the applicability of the LML arbitration clause falls to be\r\ndetermined as a matter of Swiss law, I am satisfied on the Swiss law evidence\r\nbefore the court that the same conclusion would be reached. 122. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Both parties instructed Swiss law experts on the matters of Swiss Law.\xc2\xa0\r\nASES\xe2\x80\x99s expert was Dr Phillipp Habegger of Walder Wyss. He is a Court Member of\r\nthe ICC International Court of Arbitration and a member of the Arbitration\r\nCourt of the Swiss Rules of International Arbitration.\xc2\xa0 Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s expert was Mr\r\nPierre-Yves Gunter of Python & Peter who has held various appointments in\r\nthe field of international arbitration and is currently a Board Member of\r\nSIAC.\xc2\xa0 Mr Gunter was unable to attend the hearing so that the only expert who\r\ngave evidence which could be tested by cross examination was Dr Habegger. 123. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n There was disagreement between the Swiss law experts as to whether the\r\nproject contract was a \xe2\x80\x9cspecific project\xe2\x80\x9d under the LML.\xc2\xa0 The reasons given by\r\nDr Habegger for concluding that it was such a project include those which I\r\nhave given above and I accept his evidence on this issue.\xc2\xa0 As such, it is clear\r\nas a matter of Swiss law that the arbitration agreement in the LML covered the\r\nproject contract. 124. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n In relation to the further question of whether such an agreement would\r\nprevail over the arbitration agreement in the Standard Conditions, Swiss law\r\nadopts a similar approach to English law.\xc2\xa0 As Dr Habegger stated:  \xe2\x80\x9cUnder Swiss law, an individual agreement overrides\r\na deviating provision contained in standard business terms. If no common\r\nintention can be established that the Parties simply forget to delete the\r\nreference to Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s Standard Conditions Dated 21 July 2012 contained in the\r\nContract (which, based on the evidence, appears to be the case), then we are\r\nconfronted with the case where the Parties individually agree on a neutral governing\r\nlaw but signed on the same occasion a contract that refers to standard business\r\nterms providing for arbitration under the Arbitration Act and English Law. The\r\nSwiss Federal Supreme Court holds that in such scenarios, the individual\r\nagreement prevails (Decision of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court DFC 93 II 325\r\net seq; 81 II 350: see also Decision of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court DFC 125\r\nIII 266 et seqq.)\xe2\x80\x9d 125. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n I accept that evidence. 126. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n There were, however, two further reasons as a matter of Swiss law for reaching\r\nthat conclusion. 127. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n The first is that under Swiss law, unlike English law, one considers\r\nfirst what was the parties\xe2\x80\x99 common, subjective intention.\xc2\xa0 In the present case\r\nthe relevant individuals were Mr Baysal and Mr Bond who were the only persons\r\nwith authority to conclude the contract.\xc2\xa0 It was their evidence that they\r\nalways intended the Swiss arbitration agreement to apply to any disputes under\r\nthe project contract and that it was never contemplated or intended that this\r\nwould be displaced by the English arbitration agreement in the Standard Conditions.\xc2\xa0\r\nI accept that evidence, which is supported by the important email exchange on\r\n6/7 June 2011 when English arbitration was rejected and arbitration in Switzerland, a party neutral country, agreed.\xc2\xa0 If that evidence is accepted then, as Dr\r\nHabegger states:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no further debate that the Parties agreed that the\r\narbitration agreement contained in the Limited Manufacturing Licence was\r\napplicable to the Contract and not the arbitration clause contained in the\r\nStandard Conditions Dated July 2012.\xe2\x80\x9d 128. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n The second is that if the actual, common intention cannot be established\r\nthen under Swiss law one considers what the parties intended from a\r\nreliance/good faith/objective perspective.\xc2\xa0 In this case even if, contrary to\r\nMr Bond\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, Delkor intended that the Standard Conditions arbitration\r\nclause applied, it could not have assumed in good faith that ASES would share\r\nthat view unless ASES expressly said so.\xc2\xa0 As Dr Habegger states, in the light\r\nof the email exchange of 6/7 June 2011, \xe2\x80\x9cit was of paramount importance for\r\nASES to agree on Switzerland as the seat of the arbitration\xe2\x80\x9d and in those\r\ncircumstances it is to be inferred that had Delkor pointed out the deviating\r\nclause in its standard terms \xe2\x80\x9cASES would have strongly objected.\xe2\x80\x9d  129. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n For all these reasons I am satisfied and find that as a matter of Swiss\r\nlaw the governing arbitration agreement is the Swiss law arbitration agreement\r\nin the LML. 130. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n Given that the same conclusion is arrived at whether the matter is governed\r\nby English law or Swiss law it is not necessary to determine which is the\r\napplicable law.\xc2\xa0 If it did matter, in the light of my findings as to the\r\ncontract formation and the general applicability of the LML, I consider that it\r\nis more likely to be Swiss law. 131. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n There is one further issue which arises under Swiss law and that\r\nconcerns the validity of the arbitration agreement in the light of the fact\r\nthat no canton or city is stipulated. 132. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n As Dr Habegger explained, \xe2\x80\x9cif the arbitration agreement fails to identify\r\nthe city or canton in which the arbitration shall be seated, difficulties may\r\narise as to how the arbitral tribunal shall be constituted\xe2\x80\x9d.  133. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n He pointed out that \xe2\x80\x9cmostly older doctrine and some cantonal courts have\r\ntaken the view that an arbitration agreement was invalid if the parties failed\r\nto designate a city or canton within Switzerland as the seat in their\r\narbitration agreement and if one of the parties refused to cooperate in the\r\nconstitution of the arbitral tribunal and no institutional mechanism was\r\nprovided for...\xe2\x80\x9d It was, however, Dr Habegger\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that \xe2\x80\x9cThis view is\r\noutdated and finds practically no support today in legal writing. As Laurent\r\nHirsch puts it, \xe2\x80\x98most recent and most authoritative legal literature\xe2\x80\x9d is of the\r\nopinion that an agreement on \xe2\x80\x9carbitration in Switzerland\xe2\x80\x9d is effective and\r\nsuffices to establish jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal in Switzerland...\xe2\x80\x9d. He then identified three alternative solutions, all of which he agreed with, but found\r\nthe\xc2\xa0 third\xc2\xa0 the\xc2\xa0 most\xc2\xa0 convincing, namely\xc2\xa0 that\xc2\xa0 the respondent\xc2\xa0 to\xc2\xa0 a\xc2\xa0\r\nreference\xc2\xa0 to\xc2\xa0 arbitration\xc2\xa0 is\xc2\xa0 under\xc2\xa0 a\xc2\xa0 duty\xc2\xa0 to\xc2\xa0 co-operate\xc2\xa0 and\xc2\xa0 that\xc2\xa0 a\xc2\xa0 failure\r\nto do so would constitute a breach of the principle of good faith entitling the\r\nclaimant to choose the judge to seise with the appointment of the tribunal. 134. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n 134.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr Gunter\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat\r\ntentative conclusion was that : \xe2\x80\x9cThere remains important legal uncertainty related to such\r\nclauses and it cannot be excluded that other arbitral tribunals or other Swiss\r\ncourts in different Cantons will arrive at the same conclusion and may not\r\nagree with the practical solutions suggested by some Swiss legal scholars.\xe2\x80\x9d 135. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n In his Affidavit and in evidence Dr Habegger was clear that although\r\nthere is a degree of uncertainty it was \xe2\x80\x9cdefinitely more likely\xe2\x80\x9d that such\r\nclauses would be held to be valid.\xc2\xa0 That opinion reflects the prevailing view\r\nof legal scholars and the arbitration-friendly case law of the Swiss Supreme\r\nCourt.\xc2\xa0 I accept his evidence on this issue and, on the evidence before the\r\ncourt, reject Delkor\xe2\x80\x99s case that the Swiss arbitration clause was invalid under\r\nSwiss law. Conclusion 136. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n 136.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the reasons outlined above I have\r\nconcluded that ASES\xe2\x80\x99s s.67 application succeeds.\xc2\xa0 The good faith/reliance\r\nreasons under Swiss law for concluding that the Swiss arbitration clause is the\r\ngoverning clause are factually compelling.\xc2\xa0 Although English law does not\r\novertly apply such principles it is reassuring that it reaches the same result. \xc2\xa0 '
