b'\tJUDGE MACKIE:  This is an\xc2\xa0application by the defendants for summary judgment alternatively to strike out the claimant\'s pleading and particulars.  A\xc2\xa0claim form was issued in\xc2\xa0September\xc2\xa02013.  It was a\xc2\xa0Part 8 claim.  It became a\xc2\xa0Part 7 claim in\xc2\xa0March\xc2\xa02014, when Males J so directed, because this was a\xc2\xa0case that required evidence (perhaps in itself an\xc2\xa0indication that an\xc2\xa0application for summary judgment might not have a\xc2\xa0great deal of promise).  This application was brought in\xc2\xa0September and came on for hearing the day before yesterday.  I\xc2\xa0have three bundles of documents, witness statements for the claimant from Mr\xc2\xa0Khouj himself and for the defendants from Mr\xc2\xa0Vaghadia and Ms\xc2\xa0Lapwood.  The application has been presented by Mr\xc2\xa0Richard Morgan QC, on behalf of the defendants, and resisted by Mr\xc2\xa0Dhillon QC and Mr\xc2\xa0Kuehne, on behalf of the claimant.\r\n   \tThe claimant, a\xc2\xa0lawyer from Saudi Arabia, is the administrator of the estate of Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri, who died intestate in\xc2\xa0June\xc2\xa02010, domiciled in Saudi Arabia.  Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri had been the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs for Saudi Arabia.  The claimant\'s appointment is valid not just in Saudi Arabia but also within the United\xc2\xa0Kingdom.  \r\n   \tThe defendants are two English companies.  The first defendant is an\xc2\xa0investment advisory company regulated by the FCA.  The second defendant provides property management, accounting and administration services.  It seems that the origin of the defendants lies in them, or associate companies, being the London\xc2\xa0Family Office of the Chartouni family.  \r\n   \tThe claimant says that the defendants acted as agents for the deceased and that it is entitled to inspect and copy all the defendants\' documents concerning any business relating to Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri.  The defendants deny they acted as agent for Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri and say they have no documents belonging to him or to which he is entitled.\r\n   \tThe background against which this claim is set is said to concern Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri\'s close friendship and business relationship with Mr\xc2\xa0Nabil Chartouni, a\xc2\xa0Lebanese businessman, and what\xc2\xa0are described as substantial gifts made by Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri to his Saudi niece, Mrs\xc2\xa0Kurdi, to which it is said Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri\'s heirs object.  There are apparently proceedings in Saudi Arabia brought by the family, or by Mr\xc2\xa0Khouj, against both Mr\xc2\xa0Chartouni and Mrs\xc2\xa0Kurdi.  It seems that several months after Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri\'s death, Mrs\xc2\xa0Kurdi intimated that she had received gifts from Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri and the claimant was provided with two letters, dated 13\xc2\xa0April\xc2\xa02010, apparently from Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri in effect expressing the desire that interests in assets, to which I\xc2\xa0shall refer shortly, should be transferred to Mrs\xc2\xa0Kurdi.\r\n   \tThe claimant suggests that the defendants have a\xc2\xa0much closer connection with the Chartounis than they have admitted, pointing out that the defendants have declined to disclose who owns them beneficially.  It seems that the claimant suspects that documents held by the defendants cast light on the alleged gifts made not long before Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri died.  That\xc2\xa0suspicion is intensified by the defendants\' decision not to disclose the documents.  It seems a\xc2\xa0pity that litigation should be necessary to achieve this purpose because one might have expected procedures to be available to enable third party documents, if they be third party documents, to be produced in England for the assistance of the court in Saudi Arabia, but we are where we are.\r\n   \tI\xc2\xa0turn now to the pleaded case which is the subject of the defendants\' application.  In the particulars of claim, the claimant alleges that between at least 1994 and 2010 the defendants, or each of them, undertook or managed investments on behalf of Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri, including, but not limited to, three sets of assets.  First there are Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri\'s beneficial interests in the shares of a company called Tellico, which was the owner of a\xc2\xa0flat at 20 Avenfield House in Park Lane.  Secondly there are shares purchased by Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri in Acropolis Select Funds Limited, known in the litigation as "the funds".  Thirdly there is a\xc2\xa0portfolio of private equity investments, including, apparently, investments in a\xc2\xa0number of private equity firms.  The claim is that the defendants\' activities on Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri\'s behalf included making payments from a bank account in the name of Pensaloca SA, including in relation to the funding of capital calls and the payment of proceeds or distributions in connection with the private equity investments and in connection with expenses incurred with Tellico in the flat.  It is said that between 2002 and 2010 the defendants acted on behalf Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri in relation to matters or transactions of a\xc2\xa0personal or administrative nature, including obtaining car insurance, funding Tellico and paying expenses incurred in respect of the flat.  It is said that the defendants were acting on instructions of Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri as principal and on the instructions of Mr\xc2\xa0Chartouni, who was himself acting on behalf of Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri as principal.\r\n   \tThe claimant says that, in those circumstances, the defendants were agents of Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri, by that relationship of agency owed fiduciary duties to him, including duties to account, to maintain proper records of transactions and, upon a\xc2\xa0request, to provide copies of such records.  They say that, since Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri\'s death, the duties have been owed to the claimant who is therefore, they say, entitled to inspect and take copies of the documents at the heart of the case.  \r\n   \tThe allegations in the particulars of claim are particularised by reference to the contemporaneous documents available to the estate, and correspondence received by the late Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri from, largely, the defendants.  \r\n   \tThe defendants deny these claims.  They rely on the absence of any written contract for the alleged relationship with Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri and the fact that they maintain individual client files for their clients but do not have one for Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri.  They deny as a\xc2\xa0matter of law that any duties were owed by them to the claimant in relation to assets of Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri, who was the ultimate beneficial owner.  Any such duties, they say, are owed to the current legal owner of those assets.  There are particular denials by the defendants, in relation to the three groups of assets to which I\xc2\xa0will turn shortly.  The defendants say the claimant has no entitlement to inspect documents and, anyway, a\xc2\xa0principal does not have a\xc2\xa0general entitlement to take copies of agent\'s documents.\r\n   \tIn an\xc2\xa0application of this kind, it is of course for the defendant to show that the claimant has no real prospect of success.  I\xc2\xa0will deal initially with the application for summary judgment, as that requires more consideration of the facts than the strike out.  There is no dispute about the legal basis upon which an\xc2\xa0application for summary judgment turns, there is citation of the familiar cases and the claimants rely in particular on the recent summary by Simon J in  Arcadia .  That summary lists eight considerations, including the following.  The court must consider whether the claimants have a\xc2\xa0realistic as opposed to a\xc2\xa0fanciful prospect of success.  The court must avoid conducting a\xc2\xa0mini trial without the benefit of disclosure and oral evidence.  The court should avoid being drawn into an attempt to resolve conflicts of fact which are normally resolved in a\xc2\xa0trial process.  The court must take into account not only evidence actually placed before it on the application but that which can reasonably be expected to be available at trial.  Some disputes of law and about the construction of a\xc2\xa0document are suitable for summary determination but it may not be appropriate to decide difficult questions of law on an\xc2\xa0interlocutory basis where the facts may determine how those legal issues will present themselves.  Notwithstanding 24.2(a), under CPR 24.2(b) there will be a\xc2\xa0compelling reason for trial where there are circumstances that ought to be investigated, such as a\xc2\xa0situation where there are grounds for scrutinising what appears on its face to be a\xc2\xa0legitimate transaction.\r\n   \tThe defendants raised briefly at the hearing the question of what law governs the obligations which are the subject of the action.  However, no issue has been taken about that on the pleadings and it is not necessary for me to consider that aspect.\r\n   \tMr\xc2\xa0Morgan\'s application on behalf of the defendants starts with the law of agency.  He submits that it is clear that, for an\xc2\xa0agency relationship to arise in English law, there must be an\xc2\xa0agreement, and he cites the speech of Lord Pearson in  Garnac .  Further, the rights and duties of the parties are dependent upon the terms of the agreement between them.  At that point, he cites the advice of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in  Kelly v Cooper .  He says that an\xc2\xa0agent is a\xc2\xa0person who has actual or ostensible authority to affect his principal\'s legal relations with third parties and it is from this ability to create legal relations between principal and third parties that other fiduciary obligations flow.  He cites extracts from  Bowstead & Reynolds on Agency .  He emphasises that any fiduciary duties must be accommodated to the terms of the actual agreement between the principal and his agent and he points out that there has been no particularisation of that agreement in this case. \r\n   \tMr\xc2\xa0Dhillon QC emphasises that a\xc2\xa0person may have the same fiduciary relationship with the principal where he acts on behalf of that principal but has no authority to affect the principal\'s relations with third parties.  Because of the fiduciary relationship, such a\xc2\xa0person may also be called an agent.  He points out that the principal agency relationship will not necessarily be contractual and can exist without an\xc2\xa0enforceable contract or in circumstances where no contract is possible.  He says that whether or not the parties considered themselves to be in a\xc2\xa0particular relationship is not determinative.  What matters is whether they have, as a\xc2\xa0matter of fact, placed themselves in what the law recognises as an\xc2\xa0agency.  He draws attention to passages in  Bowstead  and to the case of  Fairstar , showing that it is the duty of an agent to preserve and be ready to produce constantly to his principal accounts of all his dealings and transactions.  \r\n   \tThe differences between the parties when approaching the law of agency are more apparent than real, as is evident when one looks even at something as fundamental as chapter 1 of Bowstead.  At 1-001(1) is the passage from which Mr\xc2\xa0Morgan\'s principal submission starts:\r\n   "Agency is the fiduciary relationship which exists between two persons, one of whom expressly or impliedly manifests assent that the other should act on his behalf so as to affect his relations with third parties, and the other of whom similarly manifests are said so to act or so acts pursuant to the manifestation." \tThe claimant points to the words "so as to affect his relations" as being much broader than the initial approach adopted by the defendant.  At Article 1(4), the work records: \r\n   \t"A person may have the same fiduciary relationship with a\xc2\xa0principal where he acts on behalf of that principal but has no authority to affect the principal\'s relations with third parties.  Because of the fiduciary relationship, such a\xc2\xa0person may also be called an\xc2\xa0agent." \tThe position becomes clearer when one looks at the end of 1-002, where the author emphasises that the initial definition is intended to be read as a\xc2\xa0whole.  No single sentence should be treated as encapsulating the whole notion of agency.  The first of the propositions is no more than the first form, and he adds that the proposition in four adds for completeness another situation where the terms "agent" and "agency" may be not inappropriately used. \r\n   \tIt is not necessary and not appropriate for me to seek to resolve questions of law concerning the alleged duty to disclose records and its alleged extent on this\xc2\xa0summary judgment application.  The underlying facts are in dispute.  As Mr\xc2\xa0Morgan himself said in his oral reply submissions, each agency relationship is or may be different.  It seems to me pointless to seek to declare what the law is until the nature of the agency relationship, if any, has been properly identified.  In broad prinicple and subject to the facts, the claimant has a reasonable case that such obligations exist.  \r\n   \tSo I\xc2\xa0turn to the evidence about the alleged agency relationship.  The defendants say that two factors are an\xc2\xa0important backdrop to the evidence.  They say that, while Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri may have had an\xc2\xa0ultimate beneficial interest in certain assets, he was not the legal owner and, with respect to the shares in the fund, the first defendant was acting for that company, not Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri.  The defendants\' evidence is that they were not Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri\'s agent.  There has never been any agreement that they should be his agent.  They have never managed any property or investments on his behalf.  They say that the defendants\' documents belong to them or their clients and there are no documents to which the claimant is entitled.\r\n   \tI\xc2\xa0turn next to the three categories of asset.  \r\n   \tFirst, the flat.  The defendants say the flat was, as indeed it was, legally owned by Tellico.  The shares in Tellico were owned by a\xc2\xa0company Borrowdale.  Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri was the ultimate beneficial owner of Tellico but he disposed of that interest prior to his death.  Following the transfer of the beneficial interest, the shares in Tellico were transferred to Pensaloca.  The defendants paid bills on behalf of Tellico and it is accepted that the directors of the defendants, amongst others, held a\xc2\xa0power of attorney on its behalf.  But the defendants say that, at most, this makes the defendant agents for Tellico and that they are not answerable to Tellico.  The defendants refer to the fact that the claimant\'s plead that the second defendant was appointed to manage Tellico in place of Kleinwort Benson.  They say that, if any actions were taken by the second defendant in relation to Borrowdale\'s ownership of Tellico\'s shares, they were for and on behalf of Borrowdale, not Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri.  They point to Mr\xc2\xa0Vaghadia\'s uncontradicted evidence that the defendant did not act in relation to the management of Tellico.\r\n   \tIn contrast the claimant refers to a\xc2\xa0letter dated 15\xc2\xa0July\xc2\xa02009 in which Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri informed Kleinwort Benson that he had "decided to transfer the management of Tellico investments and my apartment in London from yourselves to the defendants," and that Carol Lapwood would be in contact with Kleinwort Benson to organise the transfer of the company\'s records.  They point out that, consistently with that intention, Ms\xc2\xa0Lapwood did contact Kleinwort Benson and assisted Mansouri in that regard, and to complete the due\xc2\xa0diligence required by Kleinwort Benson.  \r\n   \tThe claimant says that by\xc2\xa0April\xc2\xa02010 at the latest Ms\xc2\xa0Lapwood was arranging the payment of expenses incurred for the flat while pending the opening of a\xc2\xa0Tellico bank account.  That was being done from a\xc2\xa0Pensaloca bank account and she requested Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri to provide \xc2\xa320,000 on account of future expenses to be paid into that account.  The records confirm that the transfer was made.  They also point to the grant on 12\xc2\xa0January\xc2\xa02010 of powers of attorney by Tellico to Mr\xc2\xa0Chartouni, his son, a\xc2\xa0director of one of the defendants, Mr\xc2\xa0Cameron Chartouni, Mr\xc2\xa0Vaghadia and Ms Lapwood.  The claimant says the logical inference is that Tellico made that grant at Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri\'s instruction.  \r\n   \tSecondly the fund.  The defendants say that there is no evidence to suggest that either of them ever created legal relations with the fund on behalf of Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri.  The defendants reject the claimant\'s suggestion that there is a relevance in the fact that the defendants corresponded with Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri on several matters.  The defendants say that the first defendant corresponded on behalf of Acropolis Capital Limited, a\xc2\xa0Guernsey company that was manager of the fund with whom the first defendant had contracted to provide services and that none of the correspondence shows the defendants themselves creating legal relations on behalf of Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri.  On each occasion Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri contracted personally with the fund, as is evidenced by the requirement for his signature.  They say there is no real prospect of the claimant showing that the defendants created legal relations between Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri and the fund.  \r\n   \tThe claimant responds that the documents substantiate the fact of Mr Mansouri\'s investment in the fund and the fact that there was correspondence about it between Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri and Ms\xc2\xa0Lapwood.  They say that investment in the fund was one of the investments in relation to which the defendants were acting for Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri.  It points to an\xc2\xa0investment report of 30\xc2\xa0June\xc2\xa02002 which lists the investment in the fund together with the private equity investments, which I\xc2\xa0will come to next.  The claimant says that the obvious inference to be drawn from this document is that Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri\'s investment was part of a\xc2\xa0much larger portfolio of investments in which the defendants were engaged as his agent.  They also point to Ms\xc2\xa0Lapwood\'s request on 11\xc2\xa0February\xc2\xa02003 that he send her a\xc2\xa0copy of his bank transfer instruction "just as you usually do, so I\xc2\xa0can track your payment."  The claimant says that, as this was Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri\'s first investment in the fund, it cannot have been in reference to dealings undertaken by the defendants solely as agents for someone else.\r\n   \tThirdly, there are the private equity investments.  The defendant rejects claims by the claimant based on documents sent to Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri by Ms\xc2\xa0Lapwood at Mr\xc2\xa0Chartouni\'s request.  They say the documents concerned payments made by Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri to or received by him from Pensaloca, to which the second defendant provided, or provides, administrative services.  They say there is no suggestion that the defendant created any legal relations between Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri and any third party.\r\n   \tThe claimant responds that the record shows dealings between Ms\xc2\xa0Lapwood and Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri about investments in a\xc2\xa0number of funds, that Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri was receiving mail from the private equity firms addressed to him care of one of the defendants, that Ms\xc2\xa0Lapwood made payments to Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri\'s bank account representing distributions from the private equity funds and that she sought payments from him into a\xc2\xa0Pensaloca account in respect of capital calls.  Ms\xc2\xa0Lapwood also maintained and provided to Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri reports of the distributions he had received and of capital calls and which listed investments in the various funds.\r\n   \tI\xc2\xa0have referred to what the defendant says is the backdrop to the evidence.  The claimants have concerns about that evidence.  They point out that the administrator is not able to give any direct evidence of matters in dispute from his own knowledge at this stage, albeit, as Mr\xc2\xa0Morgan points out, he has access to Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri\'s papers.  The claimant says it only has correspondence which is available.  It objects to passages in the witness statement of Mr\xc2\xa0Vaghadia, which, in effect, are Mr\xc2\xa0Vaghadia\'s understanding of what Mr\xc2\xa0Chartouni says.  The claimant points to the very short and undetailed witness statements from the defendants and to the absence of any contemporary correspondence produced by them.\r\n   \tThe defendants respond that correspondence has not been disclosed because it all relates to clients other than Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri.  That of course rather begs the question behind the action.  They say that what might have been available for disclosure to Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri in his capacity as a\xc2\xa0beneficial owner is no longer available because that beneficial ownership has changed.  That may well be correct but it is a\xc2\xa0little puzzling that a\xc2\xa0company regulated by the FCA has nothing relating to its dealings with Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri, even if it did not clarify him as a\xc2\xa0personal client. \r\n   \tThe claimant also points to a\xc2\xa0letter of 9\xc2\xa0November\xc2\xa02010 from Mr\xc2\xa0Vaghadia to Mr\xc2\xa0Khouj, the claimant, in reference to the claim by then being put forward.  In the third paragraph of that letter Mr\xc2\xa0Vaghadia says this:\r\n   "As a\xc2\xa0result of the above mentioned, both Mr\xc2\xa0Chartouni and ourselves have a\xc2\xa0fiduciary responsibility only to Mrs\xc2\xa0Kurdi.  Therefore we cannot discuss her financial affairs with you or Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri\'s heirs as these assets are not part of Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri\'s estate." \tThat leads the claimant to submit that a\xc2\xa0recognition of a\xc2\xa0fiduciary responsibility to Mrs\xc2\xa0Kurdi once she was beneficial owner must also involve the existence of a\xc2\xa0fiduciary responsibility to Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri when he was in an\xc2\xa0equivalent position.  The defendants point out that Mr\xc2\xa0Vaghadia is a\xc2\xa0layman, not a\xc2\xa0lawyer, and was using the expression loosely.  That may well turn out to be the case but Mr\xc2\xa0Vaghadia is a\xc2\xa0chartered accountant and an\xc2\xa0approved person regulated by the FCA and his perception may prove to be significant.  \r\n   \tNext, the claimant points to what it says are a\xc2\xa0number of inconsistencies.  For the sake of brevity I do not identify all the alleged inconsistencies but they are set out in detail from paragraphs 21 to 51 of the claimant\'s counsel\'s skeleton argument.  The claimant says that there have been four if not five versions of events put forward at various times for or on behalf of the defendants.  Some of those alleged inconsistencies are mentioned in Mr\xc2\xa0Khouj\'s second witness statement.  Mr\xc2\xa0Dhillon submits that the attempts by Mr\xc2\xa0Vaghadia and Ms\xc2\xa0Lapwood to reconcile those matters only make things worse.  \r\n   \tMr Dhillon also identifies what he says are issues of credibility revealed in a\xc2\xa0note made by Mr\xc2\xa0Nelson of his instructing solicitors of a\xc2\xa0telephone conversation with Mr\xc2\xa0Vaghadia on 18\xc2\xa0February\xc2\xa02011.  There has so far been no refutation of these further claims made by the claimants about inconsistency and lack of credibility.  It may of course prove that there is little or nothing in those allegations but they require an\xc2\xa0answer.  \r\n   \tI return to the defences themselves which it is contended that the claimant has no real prospect of successfully defeating.  First there is the absence of a\xc2\xa0written retainer or file, and it seems to me that, on the material available, the defendants cannot show that the claimant has no real prospect of defeating that defence.  The fact that the defendant did not generate a client file for Mr Mansouri does not mean that he was not a client.  It may simply be a failure by the defendants to operate their procedures or a lack of appreciation that that would have been something which they should have done.  In addition to the points which I\xc2\xa0have already made, there is very little evidence in the material of the practices adopted by the defendants and their reliability.\r\n   \tThe other main defence is the defendants\' position that all their dealings with Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri were all on behalf of parties other than him.  The answer, at present, is that it is anybody\'s guess what the position is until the question has been investigated.\r\n   \tThe third aspect is the claim by the defendants that the claimant is not entitled to inspect or copy documents in the defendant\'s control.  As I\xc2\xa0said earlier, that raises questions both of law, where there is a\xc2\xa0good arguable claim by the claimant that they may be entitled to those documents, but also facts because the answer will depend upon the nature of the agency, if any. \r\n   \tThe Commercial Court is robust in granting summary judgment, particularly where the matter before the court is construction of a\xc2\xa0contract because of the waste of time and money caused by unnecessary trials.  It seems to me that this case is very far removed from that for the reasons that I\xc2\xa0have given.  This case turns on a dispute about facts to which will be applied a disputed view of the law.  The defendants have not shown that the claimant has no real prospect of success in its claim.\r\n   \tAs I\xc2\xa0mentioned earlier, Mr Dhillon relies in addition or alternatively on 24.2(b).  He says that, even if there were the basis for a\xc2\xa0summary judgment in favour of the defendants, there are compelling reasons for this case to go to trial.  He points out that Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri is no longer with us and we do not have his account.  He points to the surprising absence of contemporaneous documents from the defendants and to what he says are the inconsistencies in the accounts given by the defendants in their evidence.  There is another aspect.\r\n   \tIt is no doubt commendable that the defendants recognise, and seek to adhere to, the strict duties which they owe to their other clients.  However, material suggests that there may be a\xc2\xa0closer relationship between the defendants and Mr\xc2\xa0Chartouni, who appears to be in dispute with the claimant estate, than the defendants accept.  The skeleton argument submitted on behalf of the claimant was accompanied by a\xc2\xa0factual narrative setting out the facts as the claimant sees them to be.  Paragraphs 16 to 18 of that document suggest that there may be something behind what the claimant says.  Of course there may also be more than meets the eye behind the claim by the claimant. \r\n   \tThe lack of completeness, clarity and perhaps candour in what has been provided by the defendants alone suggest to me that there must be a\xc2\xa0trial.  It may well turn out that the defendants are entirely right to have adopted their cautious approach, but it is something that needs to be tried. If I was not already satisfied that this case had to go to trial under 24.2(a), the circumstances would compel a trial. \r\n   \tThat is not the end of the matter, because there is an\xc2\xa0alternative application to strike out, in effect, the pleading.  Mr\xc2\xa0Morgan points to 16PD 7.3 to 7.5 of the White Book and its requirement that, where a\xc2\xa0claim is based upon an\xc2\xa0agreement, certain particulars should be provided.  As he points out, those particulars are necessary for the fair resolution of any issues arising in relation to the alleged agreement.  He submits that the pleaded case of the claimant is stark and simply asserts that the defendants were agents of Mr\xc2\xa0Mansouri and agreed to act on his behalf in relation to various assets without giving particulars of the alleged agreement.  Despite being requested to give those particulars, he complains that the claimant has not done so.\r\n   \tHe says he is entitled to know between whom it is alleged any agreements were reached and the scope or terms of any alleged agreements, when and where the alleged agreements were concluded and other matters, and that, given the pleadings as if stands, it fails to comply with the fundamental requirements of the CPR and of the overriding objective and, therefore, should be struck out.  He points out that he has already offered an\xc2\xa0opportunity for the claimants to put their house in order, which they have declined to take advantage of.\r\n   \tMr\xc2\xa0Dhillon contends that the application is without merit.  He says that paragraph\xc2\xa07 of the Practice Direction is directed to claims based on contract and not upon an\xc2\xa0agreement of the kind relied upon in this case.  He points to the law of agency which shows that it is not necessary for the claimant to prove the creation and terms of a\xc2\xa0valid contract.  He says it is perfectly clear that the defendants understand the case being made against them.  He accepts that the pleading, as it stands, is thin but it will, he says, be developed and expanded as and when the contemporaneous documents is available following disclosure.  He repeats that he is limited by the fact that he is acting for the administrator of someone who is no longer with us and the defendants, in his submission wrongly, have not provided any of the other contemporaneous material.\r\n   \tIt is of course trite that, when an\xc2\xa0agreement is alleged, the court will order particulars of it and for generations details have been required of who the agreement was between, when it was made, where it was made, if it was in writing what the text was, and, if it was oral, what the gist was of the words used.  However, those are obligations which apply to a\xc2\xa0contractual relationship.  If one looks at the pleading as it stands, there is a\xc2\xa0series of circumstances set out between paragraphs 11 to 18.  A\xc2\xa0period of time is given between 2002 and 5\xc2\xa0June\xc2\xa02010 and the agency is said to arise in all those circumstances.  \r\n   \tThere is a\xc2\xa0need for particularity at some point but there seems to me no reason why that should not come at a\xc2\xa0later stage.  Of course one is aware of the danger of fishing expeditions, cases brought for the purpose of seeing the other side\'s documents and disclosure in the hope that they will throw up a\xc2\xa0case which can then be properly pleaded.  Of course a\xc2\xa0party has to get its case off the ground in the first place and the court is wary of proceedings being brought where that requirement is not met.  As I\xc2\xa0see it that is not this case.  The defendants are very well aware of the claims that are made against them.  They are at no disadvantage in their current state of knowledge in continuing to defend the case.  It will be appropriate for the claimant to amend its pleading but it does not seem to me that there is a\xc2\xa0need for running repairs, step by step, as one goes along.
