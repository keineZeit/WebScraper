b'MR JUSTICE ANDREW BAKER:   \tThe defendants apply for a\xc2\xa0stay of these proceedings by application notice dated 21\xc2\xa0February\xc2\xa02018.\r\n   \tThe claimant has sued each of the four defendants here as of right by, in each case, serving the proceedings at an address for service within this jurisdiction maintained by the defendant in question as a\xc2\xa0result of his directorship of one or more English companies.  It is accepted that that amounted to valid service, irrespective of whether the subject matter of the claims is connected to the companies the directorship of which generated the need to maintain that address for service.\r\n   \tThe defendants were directors of Soci\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 Anonyme, Marocaine de l\'Industrie de Raffinage (\'SAMIR\').  As its name suggests, SAMIR is a\xc2\xa0Moroccan oil-refining company.  It was placed into judicial liquidation by the Commercial Court of Casablanca by order dated 21\xc2\xa0March\xc2\xa02016.\r\n   \tThe claimant is a\xc2\xa0company incorporated in Dubai.  It carries on business in the trading of crude oil, refined oil products and natural gas.  The claimant has been admitted in the liquidation of SAMIR as a\xc2\xa0creditor, owed c.US$126m, and it has obtained a\xc2\xa0default judgment against SAMIR in this court for c.\xc2\xa388m by reference, as I\xc2\xa0understand it, to that debt.  The claimant claims in these proceedings that the defendants are liable to it in damages in respect of loss occasioned to it through entering into the contract with SAMIR under which SAMIR defaulted.\r\n   \tThree causes of action or groups of cause of action are pleaded:  \r\n   a.\tFirstly, the claimant makes a\xc2\xa0claim for losses it says were caused to it by the wrongful conduct or mismanagement of the defendants in the course of conducting the business of SAMIR as directors.  That has been referred to as the \'mismanagement claim\'. b.\tSecondly, the claimant asserts claims in deceit, alleging that it was induced by false representations by the defendants, as to which the defendants knew of the falsity or were reckless as to the falsity of the representations, to enter into the defaulted contracts. c.\tThirdly, the claimant puts forward a\xc2\xa0claim or claims for damages for what it says was an unlawful means conspiracy. \tAll three causes of action or groups of cause of action as pleaded depend critically upon allegations of fact particularised in some detail under paragraph\xc2\xa060 of the particulars of claim, but claiming essentially that the defendants caused SAMIR to continue to trade with the claimant in and after Q4\xc2\xa02014, well knowing that SAMIR would be unable to meet its resultant financial obligations or reckless in that regard.  Contrary to the defendants\' submissions or contrary at least to a\xc2\xa0certain emphasis in their submissions, those critical factual allegations are not peculiar to or creatures of Moroccan law, nor do they have an exclusively or predominantly Moroccan centre of gravity as matters of fact, although of course the connection to Morocco is not insignificant since the allegations relate to SAMIR.\r\n   \tIn the mismanagement claim, those critical allegations of fact are said to give rise to liability under Moroccan law, specifically under Article\xc2\xa0352 of Moroccan law 17-95, relating to public limited companies, and/or Article\xc2\xa077 or Article\xc2\xa078 of the Moroccan \' code des obligations et des contrats \' (\'the obligations code\').  The claimant also pleads reference to Article 903 of the obligations code, concerning the duties of agents towards their principals, but it is agreed that would at most inform the content of the defendants\' duties as directors as may be relevant to the bases of liability asserted, as opposed to giving the claimant a\xc2\xa0separate or additional cause of action.  Acting contrary to the defendants\' duties under Article\xc2\xa0352 of law 17-95 and/or Article\xc2\xa077 or 78 of the obligations code is then said to be one of the unlawful means deployed in the alleged conspiracy.\r\n   \tThe deceit claim is founded upon alleged implied representations said to have been made by the defendants personally to the claimant as to SAMIR\'s ability to perform its contractual commitments and/or as to whether they would in fact be fulfilled.  Those alleged representations are said to have been deceitful because of the critical factual allegations.  The use of deceit in continuing to trade with the claimant is then said to be the other unlawful means deployed in the alleged conspiracy.\r\n   \tA\xc2\xa0focus on the nature and detail of the claims that has been generated by this application has revealed, it seems to me, three difficulties or infelicities in the way they have been pleaded.\r\n   \tFirstly, as part of the pleading of the mismanagement claim, at paragraph\xc2\xa061 of the particulars of claim the claimant has pleaded that, pursuant to Moroccan law, it "as a\xc2\xa0creditor of SAMIR" can claim against the defendants for loss resulting from the breaches of duties the claimant alleges.  It is, however, plain on the evidence that has been generated as to Moroccan law for the purposes of this application\xc2\xa0-- and that is on both sides of the fence\xc2\xa0-- that the claimant\'s status as a\xc2\xa0creditor of SAMIR is not in fact necessary to or indeed of any direct relevance to whether it does or does not have the tortious causes of action under Moroccan law which it alleges. \r\n   \tSecondly, there is at least a\xc2\xa0question as to whether a\xc2\xa0\'personal and distinct loss\', differentiating a\xc2\xa0claimant in some way from a\xc2\xa0body of creditors of a\xc2\xa0company which has become insolvent, is required before the claimant in question has a\xc2\xa0valid claim for compensation under Article\xc2\xa0352 as a\xc2\xa0matter of Moroccan law.  I\xc2\xa0articulate that carefully because, as throughout, I\xc2\xa0wish to be clear that at this stage and in this judgment I\xc2\xa0am not in a\xc2\xa0position to and do not purport to reach determinations on any of the issues that will or may ultimately go to the merits of the claimant\'s claim.  It is thus not entirely clear to me at this stage whether the claimant for its part does accept the need for this\xc2\xa0personal and distinct loss, but on any view it is apparent, although only perhaps from a\xc2\xa0solicitor\'s letter relatively recently sent, intended to stand as further particulars, that if there is such a\xc2\xa0requirement, the claimant will say that it can satisfy it. \r\n   \tThirdly, the way in which the claimant has articulated its plea as to its loss and damage is at all events capable of creating, as it seems to me, some confusion as to the way in which it seeks to measure its damages.  It was apparent from discussion of that aspect of the pleading during argument that it is well recognised on the claimant\'s side that all the claims made are claims in tort and that, on reflection, it may not be as clear as it ought to be on the pleading that the contract prices not paid by SAMIR are, if they be relevant at all, relevant to the measuring of any damages claimed only as (it may be) evidence of the value of cargoes the claimant will say it was wrongfully induced or caused to supply to SAMIR.\r\n   \tThose concerns about the pleading do not, however, have any material bearing on the present application.  How the claimant will put its claims is in my view clear enough for the purposes of considering the exercise of any discretion to stay that may be available to the court.  That said, if these proceedings are not to be stayed, in my judgment those concerns about the pleading ought to be resolved, which I\xc2\xa0apprehend may mean striking through the erroneous or unnecessary words in paragraph\xc2\xa061, requiring a\xc2\xa0proper pleading as to personal and distinct loss for the Article\xc2\xa0352 claim, and requiring the loss and damage plea to be corrected or clarified.\r\n   \tTurning then to this application, the defendants\' application notice sought a\xc2\xa0stay on four bases:\r\n   a.\ton the basis that this court is not an appropriate forum for the resolution of the claimant\'s claims ( forum non conveniens ); b.\ton the basis that the claimant\'s claim should be stayed in favour of the Moroccan liquidation proceedings as a\xc2\xa0 lis alibi pendens ; c.\tunder Article\xc2\xa034 of the Brussels Regulation recast, on the basis that the Moroccan liquidation proceedings are related proceedings; or d.\tas a\xc2\xa0temporary case management measure pending a\xc2\xa0decision in the Moroccan proceedings as to whether the liquidation of SAMIR is to be extended to the defendants under Article\xc2\xa0706 of the Moroccan Commercial Code, something that has been recommended but not yet determined in the Moroccan liquidation proceedings, as I\xc2\xa0shall explain. \tIt is, however, common ground that Article\xc2\xa034 of the Brussels Regulation (recast) does not apply because the Moroccan proceedings are in the nature of insolvency proceedings excluded from the scope of the regulation.  Furthermore, it was authoritatively established by  Owusu\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Jackson  (Case C-281/02)  [2005] QB 801  that proceedings within the scope of the Brussels Regulation brought here against a\xc2\xa0defendant domiciled here cannot be stayed on the basis that England is a\xc2\xa0 forum non conveniens .   Owusu\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Jackson  was decided under the Brussels\xc2\xa0Convention, but subject always to the debate that continues as to the precise extent of the decision, it remains good law for the Brussels Regulation (recast).\r\n   \tIt is common ground that the fourth defendant is domiciled within the jurisdiction.  On the evidence before me for the application I\xc2\xa0am satisfied that the third defendant is also domiciled here, as the claimant has argued.  So there can be no question of staying these proceedings against either the third or the fourth defendant on the basis that England is a\xc2\xa0 forum non conveniens .  In those circumstances I\xc2\xa0do not find very compelling the suggestion that the proceedings should nonetheless be stayed against the first and second defendants.  A\xc2\xa0particular submission in that regard was that the only real target of the claimant\'s claim is the first defendant, he being, the defendants say, the only defendant with the means to discharge a\xc2\xa0liability of the order of magnitude asserted.  To my mind, though, there is no basis on the evidence presently before the court for a\xc2\xa0conclusion that the claims against the second, third and fourth defendants individually are other than serious claims properly brought (if the claims have properly arguable factual and legal merit at all, which is not something that arises at this stage).\r\n   \tI\xc2\xa0do not need to take that aspect any further, however, or conduct any balancing exercise between the undesirability of the claim proceeding against some but not all of the defendants and the factors said by the defendants to make England an unsuitable forum.  There is no  forum non conveniens  discretion to exercise, quite apart from the impact of the recast Regulation, unless the defendants demonstrate that Morocco is a\xc2\xa0 forum conveniens .  That requires, in the first place, proof that Morocco is an available forum in which the claimant could bring against the defendants the claims it is making here.  The defendants have made no attempts to prove that.\r\n   \tThe defendants\' submissions at times obscured that reality by failing to keep in mind that the claims made here, that the defendants ask me to stay, are claims by the claimant asserting personal damages liabilities owed to it by the defendants.  They are analytically and legally quite distinct from SAMIR\'s liability to the claimant, admitted in the Moroccan liquidation and the subject of the default judgment here, albeit, of course, any actual recovery by the claimant in respect of that liability will go to reduce its recoverable loss in its claims against the defendants.\r\n   \tSo what is left of the defendants\' application is  lis alibi pendens  and case management.\r\n   \tIn  Owusu\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Jackson , one question referred to the CJEU was whether a\xc2\xa0discretion available under national law could be exercised, to stay proceedings because of a\xc2\xa0 lis alibi pendens , where jurisdiction had been founded under what is now Article\xc2\xa04 of the Brussels Regulation (recast) and the proceedings in favour of which a\xc2\xa0stay was sought were in the courts of a\xc2\xa0state not privy to the Brussels-Lugano regime.  The CJEU declined to answer that question as it did not arise on the facts of the case -- there were no proceedings on foot in Jamaica.  There has been debate since as to how that question is to be answered.  At the risk of oversimplification, the debate has boiled down to this: on the one hand, the seemingly unqualified terms in which the CJEU articulated the principle by which it decided the  forum non conveniens  question in  Owusu\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Jackson  may appear to dictate a\xc2\xa0negative answer to the  lis alibi pendens  question (and, after all, there is in truth no separate doctrine of  lis alibi pendens  in English law, rather, the existence of foreign proceedings connected in some way to the proceedings here sought to be stayed is ultimately just one factor -- it may be an important factor in any given case -- but just one factor in considering whether England is a\xc2\xa0 forum non conveniens ); on the other hand, it seems surprising and unwarranted for an English court to be unable, because of the Brussels-Lugano regime, to stay proceedings in favour of, say, proceedings in Jamaica if, on otherwise identical facts, it would have been entitled or maybe even obliged to stay had the other proceedings been in, say, France or Switzerland.\r\n   \tIn  Ferrexpo AG v Gilson Investments Limited\xc2\xa0&\xc2\xa0Others  [2012] EWHC\xc2\xa0721 (Comm), [2012] 1 Lloyd\'s Rep 588, Andrew Smith J held that the Brussels-Lugano regime allowed the English court to stay on  lis alibi pendens  grounds (if that were otherwise appropriate, applying national law) where a\xc2\xa0stay would have been permitted by what is now Article\xc2\xa030 of the Brussels Regulation (recast) had the other proceedings been in a\xc2\xa0Brussels-Lugano state.  In  Plaza BV\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0The Law Debenture Trust Corporation\xc2\xa0plc  [2015] EWHC\xc2\xa043 (Ch), Proudman J held that the Brussels-Lugano regime allowed the English court to stay proceedings brought in breach of a\xc2\xa0contract obliging the claimant to bring its claim in the courts of Western Australia on the basis that such a\xc2\xa0stay was consistent with the Brussels Lugano regime given what was then Article\xc2\xa023(1) of the Brussels Regulation (now, with modified wording, Article\xc2\xa025(1) of the recast Regulation).  In doing so, Proudman J followed a\xc2\xa0decision of Norris J in  Winnetka Trading Corp\xc2\xa0v Julius Baer International Ltd  [2008] EWHC\xc2\xa03146 (Ch) and the  obiter  view of Colman J in  Konkola Copper Mines\xc2\xa0plc\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Coramin\xc2\xa0Ltd  [2005] EWHC\xc2\xa0898 (Comm) and referred to the analysis of Andrew Smith J in  Ferrexpo .\r\n   \tBy contrast, in  Catalyst Investment Group Ltd\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Lewinsohn  [2009] EWHC\xc2\xa01964 (Ch), Barling J concluded that  Owusu\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Jackson  meant what it seemed to say and ruled out even a\xc2\xa0\'reflexive\' application of what is now Article\xc2\xa029 of the Brussels Regulation (recast) in respect of proceedings in Utah between the same parties and involving the same cause of action.\r\n   \tThe staying of proceedings within the scope of the Brussels Regulation recast on  lis alibi pendens  grounds where the other proceedings are in a\xc2\xa0non-Brussels-Lugano state is now dealt with by Articles 33 and 34.  That must mean, I\xc2\xa0think, that the actual decision in  Ferrexpo , namely that a\xc2\xa0stay can be granted under national law treating Article\xc2\xa030 as having a\xc2\xa0\'reflexive\' effect, is not good law for the recast Regulation, whether or not it would have found favour with the CJEU for the original Regulation.  The question now is not whether Article\xc2\xa030 would have applied had the other proceedings been in a\xc2\xa0Brussels-Lugano state but whether Article\xc2\xa034 applies.  In any given case, that could cut either way -- Articles 33 and 34 appear to include requirements not found in Articles 29 and 30, but on the other hand they do not seem to replicate the primacy of first seisin built into Articles 29 and 30.\r\n   \tThe claimant submits as regards the third and fourth defendants that, since there is no provision in the recast Regulation entitling the court to stay these proceedings, because, as is common ground, Article\xc2\xa034 does not apply, therefore there can be no stay as against those defendants.  The defendants submit, however, that because the reason Article\xc2\xa034 does not apply is that the Moroccan proceedings are insolvency proceedings falling outside the scope of the recast regulation, it is open to the court to stay, even as against the third and fourth defendants, if it would be doing so by reference to a\xc2\xa0doctrine of national law specific to that kind of proceedings.  In that regard, they invoked what has been described as a\xc2\xa0principle of \'modified universalism\' in the context of cross-border insolvencies (see  In re HIH Casualty\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0General Insurance Ltd   [2008] 1 WLR 852 ,  per  Lord\xc2\xa0Hoffmann at [6]-[7] and [30]; and see also  Rubin\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Eurofinance   [2013] 1 AC 236  and  Stichting Shell Pensioenfonds v Krys & Another   [2015] AC 616 ).\r\n   \tClaims against the directors or former directors of a\xc2\xa0company by claimants who say those directors or former directors incurred personal liability to them through wrongdoing in the course or purportedly in the course of running the company are not uncommon.  There may be any number of difficulties in the way of such a\xc2\xa0claim in any given case, but that will be a\xc2\xa0matter for the merits.  The pursuit of such claims is not apt inherently to interfere with or undermine an orderly liquidation of the company, wherever it is incorporated, if it is insolvent.  The defendants say that this case is, however, different because of a\xc2\xa0particular, possibly unusual, feature of the Moroccan insolvency law and practice applicable to the liquidation of SAMIR.\r\n   \tPursuant to Article\xc2\xa0706 of the Moroccan Commercial Code, to which I\xc2\xa0have already made reference in passing, corporate insolvency proceedings in Morocco can be extended to the directors or former directors of the insolvent company in certain cases of mismanagement.  As the defendants submitted and was clear on the evidence as to Moroccan law adduced on both sides, Article\xc2\xa0706 and the procedure associated with it provides a\xc2\xa0mechanism through which, in cases of serious misconduct on the part of the insolvent company\'s directors or former directors, those directors\' own assets may be made available for the benefit of the insolvent company\'s creditors for the purposes of seeking to discharge directly the company\'s debts.  In other words, it provides a\xc2\xa0mechanism by which, in the eyes of Moroccan law\xc2\xa0-- that is to say Moroccan insolvency law\xc2\xa0-- the insolvent estate of the company available for the satisfaction or partial satisfaction of its creditors is effectively extended into some or all of the assets of its misfeasant directors.\r\n   \tA\xc2\xa0further provision of slightly more limited impact, but nonetheless also of potentially significant impact in any given case, is Article\xc2\xa0704 of the Moroccan Commercial Code, under which, in circumstances as specified in that article, directors or former directors of an insolvent company can be rendered personally liable to make good some particular shortfall between the assets of the company in liquidation and its liabilities to its creditors.\r\n   \tIn the present case, after an investigation within the course of the Moroccan insolvency proceedings relating to SAMIR, a\xc2\xa0request under the Article\xc2\xa0706 procedure was filed by the liquidator of SAMIR with the appointed judge supervising the liquidation process, for the liquidation of SAMIR to be extended to, amongst others, the four defendants before this court.  Again pursuant to the relevant Moroccan procedure, the appointed judge in due course concluded that the request appeared to be well founded and made a\xc2\xa0recommendation that the liquidation be so extended.  The appointed judge\'s recommendation was made to the three-person court which ultimately has the judicial function to determine the Article\xc2\xa0706 request, of which he, the appointed judge, is himself a\xc2\xa0member.\r\n   \tThat recommendation by the appointed judge came as long ago now as\xc2\xa0December\xc2\xa02017.  A\xc2\xa0decision on the recommendation is awaited.  Indeed, on the evidence before me, the next stage in the process, namely the formal service of relevant documentation has not yet been completed, at any rate as regards the defendants before me.\r\n   \tIn some of their submissions the defendants emphasised that if indeed the liquidation of SAMIR is extended to them, that will mean they are themselves subject to a\xc2\xa0species of bankruptcy proceedings.  However, there is no suggestion that Morocco is the (or a)\xc2\xa0domicile of any of the defendants; and in my judgment it is plain on the evidence before the court that they have not submitted and have no intention of submitting to the Moroccan jurisdiction.  Indeed, the defendants\' case is that, in the context of the liquidation of SAMIR, the Moroccan courts are biased and not somewhere they, the defendants, are or will be able to obtain justice.  So, as it seems to me, there can be no question of a\xc2\xa0stay at the defendants\' instance in support, as such, of the prospective quasi-bankruptcy proceedings against them under Article\xc2\xa0706.\r\n   \tThe defendants\' contention, however, was that because, thanks to Article\xc2\xa0706, the Moroccan court may conclude that their assets are to be made available as, in effect, an extension of SAMIR\'s insolvent estate, and because of the overlap between the allegations against the defendants the Moroccan court has to consider in relation to the Article\xc2\xa0706 issue and the issues raised by the claimant\'s claims here, it undermines  SAMIR\'s  orderly liquidation in Morocco to allow the claimant\'s claims here to proceed.  Indeed the defendants submitted that those claims should be seen as a\xc2\xa0vexatious attempt to circumvent the due and proper, Moroccan process of liquidating SAMIR.\r\n   \tThat is not an attractive submission coming from defendants whose case is that the liquidation of SAMIR in Morocco is not at all due and proper; who say, rather, that it is a\xc2\xa0politically driven stitch-up.  But even if that contradiction in the defendants\' position is left to the side, in my judgment there is no substance to their complaint about the proceedings here.  It is not necessary, therefore, to determine whether the discretion they ask the court to exercise is available to the third and fourth defendants or whether, if not, that would tip any balance otherwise favouring a\xc2\xa0stay of the proceedings against the first and second defendants.\r\n   \tThe defendants\' submissions and evidence of Moroccan law were, to my mind, somewhat bedevilled by failures to distinguish between (1) a\xc2\xa0question of Moroccan procedural law, namely whether any Article\xc2\xa0352 claim brought in Morocco and relating to a\xc2\xa0Moroccan company in liquidation has to be brought (by whomever) before the court conducting the liquidation of the company; (2) a\xc2\xa0possible question of title to sue, which is an aspect of the merits, namely whether, when a\xc2\xa0Moroccan company is in liquidation, only its liquidator is entitled to make or pursue any claim under Article\xc2\xa0352 against the company\'s directors or former directors; (3) another question of merits, namely whether the claimant has an arguable claim to have suffered a\xc2\xa0personal and distinct loss if that be required for a\xc2\xa0successful Article\xc2\xa0352 claim.\r\n   \tTaking those in that order: on the first question, in my judgment it is tolerably clear, despite a\xc2\xa0late-served second report from the claimant\'s Moroccan law expert, that any process seeking to extend the liquidation of SAMIR to the defendants under Article\xc2\xa0706 would be a\xc2\xa0matter for the court conducting that liquidation and that,  if the liquidation is so extended , thereafter any Article\xc2\xa0352 claim brought in Morocco likewise ought to be brought before that court.  But that has nothing to do with the question of whether the claimant\'s claim here should be stayed.\r\n   \tOn the second question, in my judgment it is clear that the claimant\'s claim under Article\xc2\xa0352, if otherwise viable, arose prior to and independently of SAMIR\'s liquidation; and I\xc2\xa0do not think there is a\xc2\xa0serious question that SAMIR\'s liquidation deprived the claimant of its entitlement to pursue any such claim.  In any event, as I\xc2\xa0said in identifying these questions, that is a\xc2\xa0matter for the merits in due course.\r\n   \tOn the third question, in my judgment it is tolerably clear that a\xc2\xa0case of deceit involving the wrongful concealment of the financial situation of the company, inducing a\xc2\xa0counterparty to trade or continue trading with the company, may be capable of generating a\xc2\xa0personal and distinct loss to the extent that may be required for an Article\xc2\xa0352 claim by the counterparty against the wrongdoing directors.  The defendants say they will submit that there is no such loss where, as here, the nature of any deceit, if established, is generic by reference to implied reassurances that (the defendants would suggest) will have been given, if given at all, equally to all of SAMIR\'s suppliers.  But all of that, again, is a\xc2\xa0matter of the merits, not a\xc2\xa0matter going to the appropriateness in this case of trying those merits here.\r\n   \tIn consequence, as regards the second and third questions and as the claimant submitted, were it clear that there was no viable Article\xc2\xa0352 claim in this case, the proper course would not be to stay these proceedings, but to strike out that claim and to consider what, if any, impact that had on the pleading of unlawful means for the conspiracy claim; a\xc2\xa0particular point there being whether the lack of a\xc2\xa0personal and direct loss if required for an Article\xc2\xa0352 claim meant that the breaches of duty involved in the Article\xc2\xa0352 claim as alleged could not amount to unlawful means.  The furthest the second and third questions could take the defendants in this court, therefore, would be to reduce the claimant to its deceit claim and a\xc2\xa0conspiracy claim, with possibly modified particulars or narrowed foundations.\r\n   \tThe pursuit by the claimant of its claims, whether they include an Article\xc2\xa0352 claim or not, in this court, before which it has brought the defendants as of right, neither circumvents nor interferes in any way with the Moroccan liquidation of SAMIR.  If in Morocco that liquidation is extended to the defendants under Article\xc2\xa0706 and if the claimant\'s claim here succeeds against any of them, questions might then arise, in the context of the enforcement of the claimant\'s English judgment, of how, if at all, any account may need to be taken of the Moroccan liquidation thus extended, but that does not call for a\xc2\xa0stay of these proceedings at any time prior to judgment.\r\n   \tIn their alternative submissions, the defendants invited me either (a) to direct an issue within the stay application as to the viability of the claimant\'s Article\xc2\xa0352 claim, or (b) to grant a\xc2\xa0stay on purely case management grounds pending clarity in Morocco as to whether the liquidation of SAMIR is to be extended to the defendants.\r\n   \tAs to the first of those, and as I\xc2\xa0have already indicated, in my judgment the question of the viability of the claimant\'s Article\xc2\xa0352 claim is a\xc2\xa0question for the merits.  A\xc2\xa0conclusion that there is no arguable Article\xc2\xa0352 claim would not result in a\xc2\xa0stay, so there is no basis for adjourning this application with a\xc2\xa0direction for the trial of an issue.  Whether an issue or issues concerning Article\xc2\xa0352, or for that matter any other issue or issues in the case, should be considered first and separately, i.e.\xc2\xa0as preliminary issues, is a\xc2\xa0matter, if pursued by the defendants, to be dealt with under normal case management processes in the case.\r\n   \tThe second alternative submission in fact involved two quite different lines of thinking.  Firstly, it was said that if the court would be minded to stay proceedings here, were the SAMIR liquidation extended to the defendants, then there should be a\xc2\xa0stay for now since the extension of the liquidation has not yet been determined in Morocco.  I\xc2\xa0do see the logic of that so far as it goes, however, my conclusion as to it is the same as for the defendants\' first alternative submission.  The extension of the SAMIR liquidation to the defendants, if it occurs, would not induce the court here to stay these proceedings.  Secondly, then, it was said that if the SAMIR liquidation were not extended to the defendants and if that were because a\xc2\xa0judgment was delivered in Morocco dismissing matters of factual complaint against the defendants that overlapped with the claimant\'s allegations here, then it would be good case management not to require the proceedings here to have progressed in the meantime, thus allowing the parties, in particular I\xc2\xa0apprehend it was being said the claimant, to take stock in the light of that hypothetical Moroccan judgment.  If there were evidence from which I\xc2\xa0could conclude that there was a\xc2\xa0real prospect of such a\xc2\xa0judgment in Morocco being delivered in relatively short order, I\xc2\xa0might perhaps have been willing to give that possibility some further consideration.  That is not the position, however.  Were there to be such a\xc2\xa0judgment during what will now be the life of these proceedings, and if it called for any modification of or addition to the parties\' cases here, I\xc2\xa0cannot see that that should give rise to any particular difficulty in managing the proceedings or any unfairness to either side.  Certainly it does not seem to me that any possible such contingent unfairness will outweigh the definite unfairness of pausing these proceedings for an unknown, indefinite and possibly extended period, with no ability at this stage to judge at all whether any such judgment will be issued and, if it is, whether it will actually have any impact on the issues before this court.\r\n   \tThis application to stay these proceedings therefore fails.  It does so on grounds that do not in fact depend on the conclusion I\xc2\xa0reached that the third defendant is domiciled here.  For completeness, I\xc2\xa0should explain briefly why that was my conclusion, in case it matters hereafter.\r\n   \tThe question of domicile for the purposes of the recast Regulation is to be determined by national law.  That is Article\xc2\xa062.  For English law the matter is governed by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Order 2001, specifically paragraph\xc2\xa09 of schedule\xc2\xa01 to that order.  The test provided by that paragraph is whether the defendant (a) is resident in the United\xc2\xa0Kingdom and (b) has a\xc2\xa0substantial connection to the United\xc2\xa0Kingdom.  Equivalent tests then apply to determine, as is also relevant here, whether a\xc2\xa0defendant is domiciled in a\xc2\xa0particular part of the United\xc2\xa0Kingdom, in this case England and Wales as opposed to Scotland or Northern\xc2\xa0Ireland.\r\n   \tThe court, in relation to the test of residency, will look at the nature of a\xc2\xa0defendant\'s relationship and connection with England, a\xc2\xa0matter of fact and degree.  A\xc2\xa0defendant who has a\xc2\xa0settled or usual place of abode in this jurisdiction will be resident here even if he or she also has one or more settled or usual places of abode elsewhere.  A\xc2\xa0person can be resident in multiple jurisdictions at any given time.  See as to all of that  Bestolov\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Povarenkin  [2017] EWHC\xc2\xa01968 (Comm); and consistent with all of that, as long ago as 1928 the House\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0Lords concluded in  IRC\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0Lysaght  [1928] AC\xc2\xa0234 that a\xc2\xa0person living generally in Ireland and who came to England but for a\xc2\xa0total of less than three months a\xc2\xa0year had a\xc2\xa0residence in England.\r\n   \tOn the evidence before the court -- which is notable amongst others for the fact that all of the detailed factual evidence as to the third defendant\'s position has been provided to the court by the claimant and not by the third defendant himself\xc2\xa0-- on that detailed evidence, the third defendant is a\xc2\xa0British citizen, although also a\xc2\xa0citizen of other nations, who spends in the region of three months in this country every year.  It may be, as is asserted on his behalf, although there is also some evidence to doubt this, that he seeks to achieve less than 90 full days of residence in this jurisdiction each year as that may have a\xc2\xa0particular impact on his treatment by HMRC for tax purposes.  That, however, seems to me to have almost nothing to do with the question of whether he nonetheless spends enough time here, with enough of a\xc2\xa0connection here, as to generate a\xc2\xa0residency here.  The third defendant has a\xc2\xa0residential property in West London where he is known to the porter and which has every appearance of being his main or a\xc2\xa0main family home.  He and his wife are jointly registered as the proprietors of that leasehold.  That is also the address for service in the\xc2\xa0case of the third defendant registered with Companies\xc2\xa0House.  He works as a\xc2\xa0partner or owner of Capital Trust Limited, an English registered company with its registered office in London.  His wife and three adult children all appear to live in London.  There is a\xc2\xa0body of evidence available on public sources online indicating strongly that the third defendant is, it may be amongst others, ordinarily resident in London, and that he ordinarily conducts his business affairs from London.\r\n   \tIn those circumstances, in my judgment the question of whether the third defendant on the evidence is resident within the jurisdiction, in fact more specifically in London, and has a\xc2\xa0substantial connection to this jurisdiction, really admits of only one answer.\r\n   \tFor completeness as to that, I\xc2\xa0should say that the claimant, if it needed to, invoked paragraph\xc2\xa09(6) of schedule\xc2\xa01 to the 2001 order, providing that where a\xc2\xa0person has been resident here for the preceding three months or more, it is to be presumed that he has a\xc2\xa0substantial connection (for the second part of the test of domicile) in the absence of contrary proof; the claimant submitting that no such proof has been forthcoming.  For the reasons I\xc2\xa0have indicated, the claimant did not need to rely on any such presumption.  The position is clear.\r\n   \tFinally, I\xc2\xa0wish to say something about expert evidence.  I\xc2\xa0mentioned at the outset that the application notice is dated 21\xc2\xa0February\xc2\xa02018, some seven and a\xc2\xa0half months ago.  When issued, it stated a\xc2\xa0time estimate for the hearing of four hours, acknowledging that that was not agreed with the claimant.  I\xc2\xa0do not know and have no complaint as to the process by which in due course this hearing came to be fixed for as long as two full days, including half a\xc2\xa0day pre-reading.  Even on the defendants\' initial estimate, on any view on what must have been an agreed final estimate, this was a\xc2\xa0substantial application with a\xc2\xa0long lead time in which, from the outset, it will have been clear that each party would wish to rely upon expert evidence of foreign law.  When issuing the application with evidence in support, the defendants provided an initial opinion from a\xc2\xa0Moroccan lawyer in fact engaged defending SAMIR\'s interests and at least indirectly the defendants\' own interests in the Moroccan liquidation.  It was acknowledged, in my judgment quite properly, by the defendants\' solicitor\'s witness statement in support of the application that expert opinion evidence from such a\xc2\xa0lawyer was far from ideal, but it was indicated that, given the applicable tight deadline for issuing any application under Part 11 for a\xc2\xa0stay on the sorts of grounds asserted\xc2\xa0-- and I\xc2\xa0paraphrase\xc2\xa0-- the evidence in question was the best the defendants could do at that stage.\r\n   \tIn those circumstances and in any event, in my judgment it is a\xc2\xa0matter of significant regret that neither side identified, as undoubtedly they ought to have, that this was a\xc2\xa0heavy application that needed case management, not least because neither side had permission for reliance upon any expert evidence, permission being required for interlocutory hearings as much as for trials.  I\xc2\xa0say that as an even-handed criticism of both sides in that, on the defendants\' side, both generally and particularly given what through their solicitors they themselves acknowledged had been a\xc2\xa0limiting factor relating to the evidence they could prepare for the application as issued, they ought to have appreciated that there was a\xc2\xa0need to regularise the matter and raise with the court what expert evidence would be required; but equally on the claimant\'s side, seeing that, identifying immediately, as they will have done, that there were matters seemingly asserted by the expert opinion that had been provided that would be contentious, the claimant ought to have identified that the defendants had not yet sought permission, that the claimant for its part would wish to challenge and deal with the matters of foreign law on their substance, not on the technicality of whether permission had been granted, and ought therefore to have raised with the defendants the need to come to court.\r\n   \tThat is not a pedantic procedural concern on the part of the court in this case.  In my view it has been a\xc2\xa0case, albeit that in the end these concerns have not become determinative of the application, in which the absence of either an agreed or directed-by-the-court review of what expert evidence was required, from what experts, answering what questions, has led to the exchange, through the service and counter-service of evidence, of an escalating volume of material not always addressing the same questions or analysing the case for the identification of the questions to be addressed in a\xc2\xa0consistent fashion and culminating in the late service of a\xc2\xa0second report by the claimant to which I\xc2\xa0referred earlier and in respect of which the defendants made a\xc2\xa0particular complaint.  (Again, happily, the objection to the late-served second report has not proved to be of determinative importance in the application.)\r\n   \tIn the circumstances, it would have been unfair in the event to both sides not to have considered the evidence such as it is that has been exchanged and the submissions that have been made on it, both sides having prepared the matter on the basis, it would seem, that the material as served would be admitted, so in the order I\xc2\xa0make today, as well as dismissing the application, I\xc2\xa0shall give permission in accordance with Part 35 for each side respectively to rely, for the purposes of the application notice of 21\xc2\xa0February\xc2\xa02018 only, on the various reports that were in fact served which can be recited in the order.  One particular reason for being to that extent pedantic about the matter is so as to emphasise thereby, in case the parties would not have taken this message away from the hearing in any event, that whilst the material that has been exchanged to date may be helpful to the parties in informing each other of the likely shape of possible expert evidence for a\xc2\xa0future trial and the issues to be addressed, it will not be the expert evidence for trial, and any question of what expertise is to be required, answering what questions, should be regarded as still a\xc2\xa0matter to be considered properly for the first time by the court with the assistance of the parties as and when the matter comes to case management in the ordinary way.\r\n   \tIn all those circumstances, the order today will be for permission in relation to expert evidence, as I\xc2\xa0have just indicated, and that the application is dismissed.\r\n   '
