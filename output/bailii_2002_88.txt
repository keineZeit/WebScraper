b'Mr Justice Langley: THE APPEAL \tThe Claimant buyers appeal, with the leave of Morison J, against an Interim Final Arbitration Award dated 30 May 2001 made by Michael Mabbs, Mark Hamsher and Christopher J W Moss.  The Respondents (\xc2\x93MSC\xc2\x94) were the demise charterers of the vessels \xc2\x93Rosemary\xc2\x94 and \xc2\x93Rafaela S\xc2\x94.  The goods suffered damage when on board the Rafaela S.\n   \tLeave was granted under Section 1 of the Arbitration Act 1979 as the reference was conducted before the 1996 Arbitration Act came into force.\n   THE AWARD \tThe subject of the Award was a preliminary issue, conducted on the assumed basis that MSC were liable in contract and tort for the damage to the goods, to determine whether the relevant shipment was one in respect of which MSC was entitled to limit its liability under the U.S. Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1936 (\xc2\x93USCOGSA\xc2\x94) or only in accordance with the more generous regime of the Hague or Hague-Visby Rules enacted by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 (\xc2\x93COGSA 1971\xc2\x94).\n   \tThat issue required the determination of two questions:\n   i)\tWhether, as the buyers contended, the \xc2\x93straight consigned\xc2\x94 Bill of Lading dated 18 December 1989 issued by MSC was a Bill of Lading within the meaning of Section 1(4) of COGSA 1971 (\xc2\x93Issue 1\xc2\x94); and ii)\tWhether, as the buyers also contended, the \xc2\x93port of shipment\xc2\x94 for the carriage of the goods pursuant to that \xc2\x93Bill of Lading\xc2\x94 was a port in the United Kingdom (namely Felixstowe) within Section 1(3) of COGSA 1971 (\xc2\x93Issue 2\xc2\x94).  Issue 2 itself depended upon whether there was a single contract of shipment from Durban to Boston or two contracts of carriage from Durban to Felixstowe and Felixstowe to Boston. Neither South Africa or the USA are parties to the Brussels Convention and the Hague Rules scheduled to COGSA 1971. \tIt is not in dispute that if the answer to either of these questions is in the negative then USCOGSA applied. That was because even if there were two contracts of carriage it was accepted by the buyers that each would have been on the terms of the straight consigned Bill of Lading: see   Pyrene Co v Scindia Navigation Co   [1954] 2 QB 402 at 419-20;   Stafford-Allen v Pacific Steam Navigation Co   [1956] 1 Lloyd\xc2\x92s Rep 104.\n   \tMSC succeeded on both questions in the Arbitration.\n   \xc2\x93THE BILL OF LADING\xc2\x94 \tThe goods were 4 containers of printing machinery.  They were shipped on board the Rosemary at Durban.  The \xc2\x93Bill of Lading\xc2\x94 was issued at Durban.  The Buyers were named as the consignees.\n   \tThe relevant sections on the face of the Bill of Lading were completed as follows:\n   Box (2) Consignee: (B/L not negotiable unless \xc2\x93ORDER OF\xc2\x94) \tJ.I. MacWilliam Company Inc., \tBox 6, New Town Branch, \tBoston, Mass. 02258, USA \t(6)  Vessel\t\t\t\t\tROSEMARY \t(7)  Port of Loading\t\t\t\tDURBAN \t(8)  Port of Discharge\t\t\t\tFELIXSTOWE \t(9)  Final Destination (through transport)\tBOSTON \tFreight Payable at\t\t\t\tDESTINATION \tThe printed language on the front of the Bill of Lading included:\n   i)\tIf box 5 and/or 9 filled out this is a through Bill of Lading (see clause 3). ii)\tReceived in apparent good order and condition ...... \tIn WITNESS whereof the number of Original Bills of Lading stated above (3) all of this tenor and date, has been signed, one of which being accomplished, the others to stand void.  One of the Bills of Lading must be surrendered duly endorsed in exchange for the goods or delivery order. \tOn the reverse of the Bill of Lading, the relevant printed terms of the contract of carriage provided as follows:\n   \t\xc2\x93Clause 1: \t1 PARAMOUNT CLAUSE ..... this Bill of Lading shall have effect subject to the ..... Hague Rules ........ the Hague Rules shall not apply where ....... this bill of lading is subject to any compulsory applicable enactment, including Hague-Visby Rules ...  If goods are shipped to or from the United States, this bill of lading shall be subject to US Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1936. \tClause 3: \t3.  SUBSTITUION OF VESSEL, THROUGH TRANSPORT, TRANSSHIPMENT AND FORWARDING. \tThe carrier agrees to carry the goods from the Port of Loading to the Port of Discharge, and shall have the right at its sole discretion to substitute other vessels, feederships, lighters or other modes of transport for the vessel named herein ...  If boxes 5 and/or 9 are filled out, the carrier will, acting as the shipper\xc2\x92s agent, only arrange for transport of the cargo by other carriers from the place of origin to Port of Loading and/or from Port of Discharge to destination ...  It is expressly understood that the Carrier\xc2\x92s liability as \xc2\x93carrier\xc2\x94 applies only from the Port of Loading to Port of Discharge under this B/L and only while the goods remain in its actual custody and control.......  \tClause 21: \t21  CLAIMS VALUATION, PACKAGE LIMITATION, TIME-BAR. ...  In case goods are shipped to or from the United States, the carrier\xc2\x92s liability shall be limited to $500 per package or customary freight unit, unless excess value is inserted on the face hereof and extra charge is paid.....\xc2\x94 THE CARRIAGE \tThe cargo was carried from Durban to Felixstowe on the Rosemary.  On arrival at Felixstowe the cargo was unloaded and shipped aboard another of MSC\xc2\x92s vessels, the Rafaela S, bound for Boston. A fresh bill of lading was not issued in respect of the Felixstowe-Boston leg of the journey.\n   \tThe Buyers allege that the cargo was damaged beyond economic repair, during the Felixstowe-Boston voyage.\n   THE SUBMISSIONS \tThe Buyers contended that the Hague-Visby Rules applied compulsorily to the Felixstowe-Boston leg of the journey on the basis that:\n   i)\tThe contract of carriage contained in or evidenced by the Bill of Lading terminated at Felixstowe. ii)\tA fresh bill of lading ought to have been issued in respect of the Felixstowe-Boston leg of the voyage. iii)\tThe bill of lading would have been issued in the UK. iv)\tAccordingly, the Port of shipment was Felixstowe and not Durban and pursuant to Section 1(3) of COGSA 1971 the Rules compulsorily applied to the carriage. \tMSC submitted that the Hague-Visby Rules did not apply because:\n   i)\tA straight consigned bill of lading is not a bill of lading within Section 1(4) of COGSA 1971.  The Rules were not, therefore, compulsorily applicable to the Bill of Lading nor would they have been applicable to a fresh bill of lading had one been issued in relation to the Felixstowe-Boston leg. ii)\tThe whole voyage from Durban to Boston was governed by one contract of carriage, namely that contained in or evidenced by the Bill of Lading.  Accordingly, the port of shipment was Durban and not Felixstowe. THE REASONS FOR THE AWARD \tThe Arbitrators decided on Issue 1 that:\n   i)\tThe Bill of Lading was non negotiable; ii)\tIt was not therefore a document of title in the accepted sense; iii)\tThe form of the Bill of Lading used was designed for various circumstances including when the Bill was to be negotiable and when it was to be non negotiable.  The form of the Bill therefore had to be construed in the light of the particular circumstances of each case and in some circumstances parts of the form would have to be read as if the words \xc2\x93if applicable\xc2\x94 had been inserted; iv)\tThe requirement that delivery be made against the Bill and only against the Bill in the printed language on the front of the Bill was intended for use when the Bill was negotiable and was not applicable when the Bill was non negotiable as in such a case the carrier was plainly obliged to the named consignee and only that person if he was to comply with the contract; v)\tThe Bill in this case was straight consigned and hence was not a Bill of Lading under the 1971 Act. \tThe Arbitrators also decided on Issue 2 that:\n   i)\tThe Bill of Lading covered the entire shipment from Durban to Boston and requirement shipment for the entirety of the passage to Boston; ii)\tThe Bill contained the contract between shipper and carrier; iii)\tThe terms of the Bill required MSC to carry the cargo themselves as far as Felixstowe and then gave them the option to use another carrier for the balance of the shipment. If they did not use another carrier and merely completed the carriage themselves then no fresh contract or shipment arose. ISSUE 1 \tSection 1(4) of COGSA 1971 provides:\n   \t\xc2\x93nothing in this section shall be taken as applying anything in the Rules to any contract for the carriage of goods by sea, unless the contract expressly or by implication provides for the issue of a   bill of lading or any similar document of title\xc2\x94 \tSection 1(6)(a) provides:\n   \t\xc2\x93the Rules shall have the force of law in relation to - (a) any   bill of lading \xc2\x94 \tSchedule - The Hague Rules as amended by the Brussels Protocol 1968 provide:\n   \t\xc2\x93Article I ... (b) \xc2\x91Contract of carriage\xc2\x92 applies only to contracts of carriage covered by a   bill of lading or any similar document of title.... \tArticle II ... under every contract of carriage of goods by sea the carrier, in relation to loading, handling, stowage, carriage, custody, care and discharge of such goods shall be subject to the responsibilities and liabilities, and entitled to the rights and immunities hereinafter set forth ...... \tArticle III Rule 7 .... the bill of lading to be issued by the carrier .... to the shipper shall, if the shipper so demands, be a \xc2\x91shipped\xc2\x92 bill of lading, provided that if the shipper shall have previously taken up   any document of title   to such goods, he shall render the same against the issue of the \xc2\x91shipped\xc2\x92 bill of lading.\xc2\x94 \tThere is no definition of a \xc2\x93bill of lading\xc2\x94 in COGSA 1971.  But plainly the sub-section is referring to a bill of lading as a document of title.  Mr Croall submits that it is also plainly referring to a negotiable or transferable document of title in the sense that property in the goods can be transferred by endorsement and delivery of the bill itself.  That is not the case with a straight consigned bill of lading such as this bill of lading is agreed to be.  Mr Schaff submits that there is no authority which conclusively determines that a straight consigned bill of lading is not within section 1(4) of the Act and that as this bill of lading was a document of title \xc2\x93in the hands of the named consignee\xc2\x94 and it was (so he submits) \xc2\x93the Buyers\xc2\x92 document of title\xc2\x94 or \xc2\x93his document of title\xc2\x94 so it falls within the sub-section.  Mr Schaff submits (albeit there is no evidence before the court as to the sale contract) that the bill of lading was the document which between seller and buyer would be delivered when title passed under the contract of sale and, relying on the printed words on the Bill of Lading, was the document which the consignees were required to produce and which MSC was required to have produced for delivery of the cargo to be made.\n   \tIn my judgment Mr Croall is right and Mr Schaff wrong in these submissions.  A \xc2\x93document of title\xc2\x94 in this context is, I think, the antithesis of a document which can evidence the title of only one person. It is general not specific to one person. It is a document by which goods can be transferred by endorsement and delivery of the document itself.  A straight consigned Bill of Lading is not such a document.  Indeed the parties to this Bill have a choice, exercisable by inclusion in Box (2) of the words \xc2\x93Order of\xc2\x94 before naming the Consignee, whether or not to constitute the Bill a document of title in the sense to which I have referred.\n   \tWhilst in terms of strict analysis Mr Schaff is right that no binding authority has determined the question, the consistent and overwhelming burden of judicial and other legal sources is against his submission.\n   \tThe established definition of a bill of lading includes the characteristic of \xc2\x93transferability\xc2\x94 of title to the goods:   Scrutton on Charterparties , 20th Ed. Article 2, pages 1-2;   Benjamin\xc2\x92s Sale of Goods , 5th Ed. para 18-007;   Carver on Bills of Lading , 1st Ed para 6-007 and 6-014.    The Law of Commission Report   (Law Com No 196) which led to the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 noted, at paragraph 2.50, that a straight consigned bill of lading was not a document of title at common law.  The terms of the 1992 Act itself reflect that in Section 1(2).  I also agree with Mr Croall that the   travaux pr\xc3\xa9paratoires   for the Hague Rules support the same conclusion.  So, too, do the terms of Section 1(6)(b) of COGSA 1971 itself which makes express provision for circumstances in which \xc2\x93a non-negotiable document\xc2\x94 may result in application of the Rules.\n   \tIn   The Happy Ranger   [2001] 2 Lloyd\xc2\x92s Rep 530 at page 539, and following the reasoning of Bingham LJ in   The Captain Gregos   [1990] 1 Lloyd\xc2\x92s Rep 310 at 317-8, Tomlinson J said:\n   \t\xc2\x93it also seems to me plain that the expression bill of lading as used in both section 1(4) of the COGSA 1971 and in Article 1(b) of the Rules set out in the Schedule thereto must refer to a negotiable or transferable document of title.  This is plainly what Lord Justice Bingham thought, and in my view the language used, with its reference to any similar document of title, does not readily admit of any other construction.\xc2\x94 \tI agree.  In   Hugh Mack & Co v Burns & Laird Lines   [1944] Lloyd\xc2\x92s Rep 377 at 383 Andrews LCJ held that \xc2\x93above all\xc2\x94 the reason why a receipt for goods marked \xc2\x93non-negotiable\xc2\x94 was not \xc2\x93similar to\xc2\x94 a bill of lading was precisely because it was not \xc2\x93a negotiable instrument, the endorsement and delivery of which may affect the property in the goods shipped\xc2\x94.\n   \tAlthough Mr Schaff relied upon the authors of   Schmitoff\xc2\x92s Export Trade , 10th Ed at paras 15-024 and 15-038 as expressing a contrary view I am far from certain that they do not.  But even if that is the case it is a view which I think to be out of line with the language of the Act and the opinions and authorities to which I have referred.\n   \tThat is sufficient, in agreement with the arbitrators, to dispose of this Appeal in favour of MSC.  But I would add that in any event I do not think the printed words in the Bill of Lading requiring surrender of the Bill against delivery of the goods can bear even the weight which Mr Schaff seeks to put on them.  MSC were obliged to deliver the cargo to and only to the consignees.  That obligation and the concomitant entitlement of the consignees is not affected by whether or not the consignee has or surrenders the Bill of Lading. It is a consequence of the agreement between MSC and the shipper to be found in the fact that the Bill of Lading names the consignee without the words \xc2\x93Order of\xc2\x94.  Nor does MSC need the protection of delivering only in exchange for the Bill of Lading as it would with a transferable Bill.  Whilst the point is one of some nicety, I also agree with the Arbitrators that delivery against the Bill of Lading was not necessary.  The printed words appear in a document which can be used either as a straight consigned bill of lading or as a transferable bill of lading.  The language used is indicative (\xc2\x93duly endorsed\xc2\x94) of the latter.  The proper construction and application of the words may properly be influenced by the chosen use:   The Chitral   [2000] 1 Lloyd\xc2\x92s Rep 529.\n   ISSUE 2 \tIt is not necessary to address this issue but as it was fully argued and I differ from the conclusion of the Arbitrators upon it, I should shortly give my reasons for doing so.\n   \tThe terms of the Bill of Lading in my judgment plainly contemplated a shipment from Durban to Felixstowe as the \xc2\x93port of discharge\xc2\x94.  Boston was the \xc2\x93final destination\xc2\x94 and Clause 3 of the printed terms entitled MSC, as agent, to arrange further transport from Felixstowe to Boston. I cannot read clause 3 as giving MSC an \xc2\x93option\xc2\x94 to complete a single shipment from Durban to Boston itself with a power to tranship en route (see   The Anders Maersk   [1986] 1 Lloyd\xc2\x92s Rep 483 and contrast   Stafford-Allen , above).  Had only one \xc2\x93shipment\xc2\x94 been intended Box 8 would, I think, have been completed by entering Boston not Felixstowe.\n   \tThe only factor on which Mr Croall relies as pointing towards a single shipment is that the freight was payable at Boston.  But I do not find that convincing.  It is no surprise that the freight should be payable at Boston when it is not in issue that MSC was also obliged to arrange the shipment of the cargo from Felixstowe to Boston.\n   \tThe contract has, of course, to be construed at the time it was made. At that time I think the parties plainly contemplated and the contract provided for two shipments under separate contracts.  The fact that in the event MSC performed both shipments cannot alter the construction of the contract.  Moreover even what occurred is consistent with that construction.  The cargo was discharged from the Rosemary at Felixstowe and loaded on the Rafaela S.\n   CONCLUSION \tIn the overall result, however, as I stated at the conclusion of the hearing, the Appeal will be dismissed and I will hear the parties on any consequential orders when this judgment is handed down.\n   '
